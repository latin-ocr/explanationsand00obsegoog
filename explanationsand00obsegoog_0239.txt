“ Sin : I have the honor to report that at 9.30 A. M„ a deep sounding was taken, in obedience to your
instructions. 1 regret that 1 am unable to give the result with any reliable precision. Two thirty-two pound
shot were first used and eight hundred fathoms were run out in exactly ten minutes time. The reel was then
checked to allow the shot to become plumb, when the line, from some defect, parted about fifty fathoms below the
surface. One 3211). shot was then attached 3ηά 1113 experiment repeated. Fifteen hundred fathoms were taken
down, but the reel working slowly and the drift becoming large, a second 32 111. 31101 was sent down by a
messenger. After checking nearly half an hour to allow the shot to become plumb and the second shot 10
133311 1113 first, the line was veered to twenty-three hundred fathoms. The 31101 seemed now to be lodged and
the reel was stopped. As the ship drifled the strain gradually increased until the tension became extreme, and
the line parted finally one hundred fathoms from the surface. As the angle made by the line during the last
stoppage did not vary as in the previous stoppageS, and the shot felt as if firmly anchored, 1 concluded that
bottom had been reached ; but owing to the drist, as well as to the uncertainty os the exact moment when the
shot lodged, the perpendicular measurement can be only raguely determined. 1 am quite sure that the first
31101 was afloat when the second was attached (at 1500 sathoms) and almost equally so that one or both had
struck bottom before the line parted. The depth is therefore between 1200 3ηά 2300 fathoms. Perhaps the

mean os these would give a sair proximate measurement with sufficient allowance for drift and swag line 3—

that is nineteen hundred fathoms.’'

“ Srn: 1 have the honor to report the result os our deep-sea soundings of this morning. The first cast
was taken with two 32 lb. shot, which struck bottom at three hundred and twenty fathoms. The line parted,
upon rousing in, near the sur-face.

The reel which 1 had prepared, by your directions, of double line for the purpose of sounding with a lead,
was then used, and a pea-shaped lead (12 1113.) well armed, brought up a specimen of the bottom (coarse,
tenacious clay) from the (1311111 of two hundred 3ηά eighty fathoms.

This cast was taken with great accuracy. The difference between the two casts may be accounted for by
some drift in the first, and by the great velocity of the reel, which took off more line than necessary to measure
the depth. As we have neared the land fifty miles since our sounding of yesterday‚ which was calculated to

be 1900 sathoms, 1 am not prepared to say that our shoal sounding to·day disproves the other; and it 13 3130

possible that the last was taken upon ‘a bank, and deeper water may be found nearer the land.''
