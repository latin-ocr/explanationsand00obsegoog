must therefore overflow to the South, as that of St. Roque does to the North, carrying to Patagonia and the
Falkland Islands, beyond 500 S., the winter climate of Charleston, South Carolina, on our side of the North
Atlantic3 or of the “ Emerald Island,'’ on the other.

From this source and from the Lagullas current, which receives its heat from the Indian Ocean,-the South
Atlantic is covered with a mantle of warmth which tempers to such a remarkable degree the climate of South
America.

Because Western Europe had a mild climate and an ocean to the westward, and the eastern shores of

North America a severe winter climate and an ocean to the eastward, a generalization has been deduced as to

the climates of countries which have an ocean to the West, and of those which have an ocean to the East, which

does not hold good.
This cauldron in the Gulf of Guinea and the Indian Ocean, which heats water for'the South Atlantic‚

ν causes this rule, so far as the extra-tropical climate of South America is concerned, to have its exception&

All geographers have noticed, and philosopher-s have frequently remarked upon, the conformity as to the ·
shore-line profile of equatorial America and equatorial Africa.

It is true, we cannot now tell the reason, though explanations, founded upon mere conjecture, have been
offered, why there should be this sort of Jutting in and jutting out of the shore line, as at Cape St. Roque
and the Gulr of Guinea, on opposite sides of the Atlantic ; but one of the purposes at least, which this pecu·
liar configuration was intended to subserve is without doubt now revealed to us.

We see that by this configuration‚ two cisterns of hot water are formed in this ocean, one of which dis·
tributes heat and warmth to Western Europe; the other, at the opposite season, tempers the climate of Eastern

Patagonia.
Phlegmatic must be the mind that is not impressed with ideas of grandeur and simplicity as it contem·

plates that exquisite design, those benign and beautiful arrangementS, by which the climate of one hemisphere

is made to depend upon the curve of that line against which the sea is made to dash its waves in the other.
lmpressed with the perfectiori of terrestrial adaptationS, he who studies the economy of the great cosmical ar·
rangements is remindedtthat not only is there design in giving shore lines their profile, the land and the water
their proportionS‚ and in placing the desert and the pool where they are; but the convictionis forced upon him
also, that every hill and valley, with the grass upon its sideS, have each its office to perform in the grand design.

Returning now to the study of Plate VII, and to the contemplation of the isotherms of 800, for the different

monthS, we are struck with the remarkable bending of all these lines towards the equator, on the eastern side
of the Atlantic. This feature in them indicateS, more surely than any direct observations upon the currents
cao dc, the presence, along the African shoreS, of a large volume of cooler and running waterS.

These are the waters which, heated up in the cauldron of St. Roque, in the Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of
MexicO, have been made to run to the North, loaded with beat, to temper climates there. Having performed
this office, they are obedient still to the “ Mighty Voice” which the winds and the waves obey. They are re·
turning by this charmel along the African shore to be again replenished with warmth and to keep up the system

of beneficent and wholesome circulation designed for the ocean.
