Conditions upon which the* Wind and Current Charis aresarnislzed to· navigatore.

These cbarts are based upon information collected for the most part by private ship owners and masters,
The information being furnished to the Governrnent gratuitously‚ the Government incurs the expense of pub·
lishing it and of making it available to navigator& The Government then offers a copy of the chart so published
to every navigator, upon condition that he will continue to keep and forward to this office abstract logs of his
voyageS, which abstracts are required to be kept according to the form herein prescribed.

Evety navigator, wh0, aster receiving a copy of the charta, fails to comply with these conditionS‚ viz : tn
keep abstracts of his voyages as per form, and to transmit them to me at the National Observatory on his re·
turn to the United StateS, forfeits his claim to all future publications.

A form of the Abstract Log is appended‚ and 1 take this opportunity to say, the point of the compass
from which the wind blows is what is wanted, also the variation obser-ved, and not the variation that is taken
from charts or books.

&The Abstracts are to be bound. Navigators in keeping them and in cutting the leaves out to be returned

to this office, will please bear this fact in mind—and leave blank margins for binding 3—-and enter their winda,

remarks and tbe like, so that all for the same day may be read at one opening, as on the pages 486, 487.
And whalemen will please recollect that their abstracts must embrace sor every day they are not at anchor

a regular record os their Lat. and Long., force and direction os the wind three times a (185¹, temperatum of the

air and water, and mention of whales whenever seen.
