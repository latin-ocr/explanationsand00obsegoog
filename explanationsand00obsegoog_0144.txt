Surely an hypothesis which, being followed out, suggests so much design, such perfect order and arrange·

ment, and so many beauties for contemplation and admiration as does this, which sor the want of a better

hypothesiS, though it be not based entirely on the results os actual observation, cannot be regarded as wholly

vain, or as altogether profitless.

The open Sea in the Arctic Ocean.

As a supplement to this chapter I may be excused sor introducing Lieut. De Haven's Report after his
return from the Arctic ocean in search of Sir John Franklin and his companions. The instructions under which
he went, and the source whence those instructions were in a measure drawn, make us acqua'inted with a few
facts that throw some light upon the circulation of the ocean, so far as the salts os the sea are concerned in
imparting dynamical forces to it.

His instructions, based entirely upon theory and the convictions of the mind in the correctness of its rea·
soning and powers of deduction, pointed him to an open sea, in the midst of the ice, and he found it there.

In the instructions which issued from the Navy Department for his guidance during that expedition, stress

. was laid upon an open sea to the Northward and Westward os Wellington channel.

“ There are other facts‚'' he was told in these instructionS, “ elicited by Lieut. Maury in the course of his
investigations touching the winds and currents of the ocean, which go also to confirm the opinion that
beyond the icy-barrier which is generally met in the Arctic ocean, there is a polynia or sea free from ice.'’

- Moreover, Lieut. De Haven was reminded in these instructions that it was needless to repeat to him the
reasons for asserting so confidently the existence of this open sea, because, said his instructions, ‘⁶ you have
assisted in those investigations at the National Observatory‚ and are doubtless aware of the circumstances which
author-ize this conclusion.''

These circumstances are detailed in the following letter which was then on the tiles of the Department‚
and which had been written soon after the American whalers had been first invited to seek information concerning

the missing expedition.
