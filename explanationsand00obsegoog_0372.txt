As a general rule, when a vessel gets into this region of light airs and calmS, she should always prefer
that tack on which she can make the most southing. It is evident from the direction in which this calm belt
lies, that a vessel that attempts to fan along to the eastward in it, is not only making no progress in crossing
it, but that she is running along its length, and-therefore prolonging her stay in it.

Vessels bound to South America and ,attempting the new route in June, are recommended not to go far-
ther East in the calm belt, if it can be avoided, than Long. 280 W.

The vessels whose passages are longest for June, followed the new route till they lost the N. E. trades ;
and then sor sear of falling to leeward, abandoned it, and went running along to the eastward in the belt of
equatorial calms—whereby they no doubt considerably prolonged their passages. Thus the “ Ann Hood,''
the “ Charleston,’' and the “ Channing,'' went as far as 230 W., and they were delayed, severally, 16, 10 and
8 days in crossing the calm belt. The “ Saxonville’' and “ Prince de Joinville'' went as far as 160 W.,
and were delayed, the former ll, and the latter 8 dayS, in consequence of prolonged calms and baffling
winds. ’

Yet, notwithstanding the bad luck which thus prolonged the sum total of their passages 53 dayS, the ave·

tage of the 10 by the new route to the Line is leSS, by 8 days and a little over, than the average for the same

mouth by the old route.

and the prevalence of the S. W. monsoons. When you get east os 280 W., these winds are found to prevail
