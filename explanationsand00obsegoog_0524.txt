“This ship is one ofthe glorious fleet of a ‘thousand sail’ that is voluntarily engaged in making observa·
tions for the wind and current chartS. She it is, it will be recollected, who, taking them for her guide, made
the extraordinary run osone hundred and three days from New York to San Francisco, both crossing the
Equator in the Pacific‚ and arriving in port on the day predicted.

“ Returning from the Sandwich lslands to New York in the remarkably short run of eighty-two days,
she passed through a part ot the “ Great South Sea,’' which has been seldom traversed' by tratlers-at least
Ι have the records of none such.

“Little or nothing, except what conjectures suggested, was known as tn, the winds in this part os the
ocean. The results of my investigations elsewhere, with regard to winds and the circulation of the atmos-
phere, had enabled me to announce as a theoretical deductiori, that the winds in the ‘ variables’ of the South
Pacific would probably be found to prevail from the westward with a tradewind like, regularity.

‘⁴ Between the parallels os 45 and 55 degrees south, and from the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope east-
ward, around to that of Cape Horn, there is no land or other ‹listurbing agent to intercept the wind in its reg-
ular circuits 3 here the winde, it was conjectured, would be found blowing from the west with greater force than from
the east in the tradewind regions ; and, giving rise to that long rolling swell peculiarto those hyperborean regions·
of the Pacific‚ they would enable ships steering east to make the most remarkable runs that have ever been

accomplished under canvass.

“The “ Sovereign of the Seas '’ has afforded the most beautiful illustration as to the correctness of these
theoretical deductionS.

“ Leaving Oahu for New York, via Cape Horn, 13th February last, she stood to the southward through
the belts, both os the northeast and the southeast tradeS, making a course good on the average through them,
a little to the west os south. She finally got clear of them, March 6th, after crossing the parallel of 45 de-
grees south, upon the meridian of 164 degrees west.

“ The 8th and 9th she was in the horse latitude weather of the Southern hemisphere. So far, her run
had been good, but there was nothing remarkable in it.

“ Having crossed the parallel of 48 degrees south, she found herself on the loth, fairly within the trade·
like west winds of the Southern ocean; and here commenced a succession of the most extraordinary days’ runs
that have ever been linked together across the ocean.

“From March 9th to March 31st, from the parallel of 48 degrees south in the Pacific, to 35 degrees
south in the Atlantic, during an interval of twenty-two dayS, that ship made 29 degrees of latitude, and 126
of longitude. Her shortest day’s run during the interval, determined by calculation, from the position given in
the log, being 150 knots. The wind, all this time, is not recorded but once with easting in it3 it was steady and
fresh from the westward.

“ In these twenty-two dayS, that ship made five thousand three hundred and ninety-one nautica} miles.

But that you may the more conveniently contrast her performance with that of railroad cars and river steamerS,

I will quote her in statute miles.
