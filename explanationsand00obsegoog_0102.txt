My friend Lieut. De Haven was about to sail in command of the American Expedition in search of
John Franklin. Infusoria are sometimes found in sea-dust‚ rain-dropS, hailstones or snowflakes; and if
any chance it should so turn out that the locus of any of the microscopic infusoria which* might be fon
descending with the precipitation of the Arctic regions should be indentified as belonging to the regions os
S. E. trade windS, we should thus add somewhat to the strength of the very slender clue by which we w
seeking to enter into the chambers of the wind, and to “tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth.'’

It is not for man to follow the “ wind in his circuit8,” and all that could be hoped waS, after a cl«

examination of all the facts and circumstances which these charts have placed within my reach, to point ι

that course which seemed to be most in accordance with them, and then having established a probability or ex

a possibility as to the true course of atmospheric circulation, to make it known and leave it for future inves
gations to confirm or set aside.

It was at this stage of the matter* that my friend Baron von Gerolt, the Prussian Minister, had the kin
ness to place in my hand Ehrenberg’s work, “ Passat-Staub und Blut-Regen.''

Here Ι found the elue which I hoped, almost against hope, De Haven would place in my hands,

That celebrated microscopist reports that he found South American infusoria inthe blood-taius, and se
dust of the Cape Verd IslandS,—Lyons, Genoa, and otherplaceS.

Thus confirming, as far as such evidence can, the indications of the “ Wind and Current Charts,'' ar.
increasing the probability that the general course of atmospherical circulation is in conformity with the sugge:
tions of the charts as I had interpreted them, viz: that the trade winds of the southern hemisphere ast«
arriving at the belt of equatorial calms ascend and continue in their course towards the calms of Cancer as a
upper current from the S. W., and that after passing this zone os calms‚ they are felt on the surface as the pr«
vailing S. W. winds of the extra-tropical parts of our hemisphere 3 and that for the most part they bring the:
moisture with them from the trade wind regions of the opposite hemisphere.

Continuing on towards the North pole from the S. W. they enter the Arctic regions on a spiral curve
continually lessening the gyrations until, whirling about in a directim contrary to the hands qs a match, this
air ascends and and commences its return as an upper current towards the calms of Cancer.

It returns to this zone from the opposite direction, N. E„ by which it' approached the pole.

The atmosphere in this part of the circuit is moving in the direction called ε’ in a previous part of thi=
paper.

Arrived at the calms of Cancer, ε’ meets θ’ in the upper regions of tbe atmosphere.

They both descend—and the fact that the barometer stands higher here† than upon any other parallel

shows that here there is an increased atmospheric pressure, caused in part by accumulation produced by the

opposing forces of ε’ and δ” ; and in part by the downward currentS.
