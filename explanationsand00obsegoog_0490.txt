The following sailing directions for entering the port of Acapulco, are by Lieut. Blunt:

“ In making Acapulco from the North, keep close to the beach, (there are no out lying rockS,) and when*
the beach ceaseS, commences the high lands seaward of Acapulco. When near the harbor, say three miles off,
the Island will begin to show pretty plainly, and the narrow passage between it and the main will be visible ς,

and further along will appear another headland not unlike the Island, which, though apparently disconuected‚
is joined to the main by a low neck. Beyond the former, and to the North of the latter is the entrance.

“ To steer in, keep, when to seaward, close to the Island, and passing it, stand over to the southeast shore
to avoid some rocks which lie southward and east of the-end of the Island, which rocks are above water but low.
- After passing these rockS, keep close to the left hand point, (say one hundred yards off,) and steer in for the
town, leaving the Fort on the right, and running up within a cable's length of the beach if desirable. All the
shore on the left is bold. These directions are for the night, and the main thing is to keep close to the beach.
In the day time it can scarcely be missed. Water is procured from wells and towed off in caskS. Fruits and

fresh provisions are abundant, with plenty of poultry, eggs, &c.'’

 

In homage of science and of the enter-prise, 1 recommend for observance, the following

‘⁶ NOTICE.”
“ Tarm-nr Houss, London, December 23⁶1, 1851.

Notice is hereby given, that in order to prevent mischief occurring to the Sub-marine Telegraph, it is
desirable that vessels should not anchor off the South Foreland when the high light-house bears between N.
and N. W. and within the drstance of three or sour miles from the shore; nor is beyond that distance,

when it bears N. W. by N ., on which bearing it will appear in one with a dark patch on the ctiff.
. And⁰as respects the opposite, or southern side of the channel, it is equally desirable that vessels should
not anchor when the two conspicuous windmills which stand on the high ground between Calais and the

Village of Sangatte, bear between S. by Ε. and S. Ε. by S. By order,
J. HERBERT, Secretary.''
