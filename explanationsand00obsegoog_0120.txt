in the Gulf, but we should have a mean level between evaporation 3ηά precipitation. Is the former' wer

excess‚ the level of the Gulf water's would sink down until the surface exposed to the air would be‘just s*

cient to return to the atmosphere‚ as vapor, the amount of water 'discharged'by 'the rivers, the Mississippi
otham, into the Gulf. As the waters were lowered, the extent of evaporating surface would grow less and l

until nature should establish the proper ratio between the ability of the air to take up, and the capacity of
rain to let down. Thus we might have'a sea whose level would be much further below the water level of
ocean, than is the Dead sea.

There is still another process besides the two already alluded to, by which the drainage of these inlr:
basius may, through· the agency of the windS, have been cut off from the great salt seas; 3ηά that is by
elevation os continents from the bottom of the sea in distant regions of the earth, a'nd the'substitution·ca=1:
thereby of a dry land for a water·sursace as the source of vapor supply to the winds that blow over the pla

From what part of 'the ocean, 1 again ask, comes the vapor that forms the rains that fall on that imme1
water-shed to which the American lakes give drainage ἓ My investigations have sugges ted the idea that they col
from the trade-wind region of the South Pacific ocean.. Certain it is, that they must come from the s.
‘a'nd not from the land3 for in this view, 1 do not consider that the rain which falls to·day, 3ηά is taken
'straightway into the clouds to be precipitated again to-morrow3 but 1 consider the excess of the precipitation oi
the evaporation, which, in this case,¹ is the volume of water discharged by the ·St.<Lawrence into the sea3 th
is the amount ‘of water which has to be taken up from the sea again, carried back through the air to the La‘.
’Βουτώ-γ, 3ηά precipitated upon it. And 1 therefore repeat the question ε Where, from what portion of the oc'e
'was the water which is 'discharged ‘by the St. Ifawrence taken up into the air? 1‘t must be taken up fro
“ som'e portions where the evaporation is greater than the precipitation ; 3ηά that is only in the trade-wind regiot
and it must also be taken up where'the mean temperatura, or at any rate, where the mean dew point is high
than it is in the Lake country ; for aster moisture gets into the atmosphere‚ it is only by lowering the dew-poli:
that we ‘can‘ get it out again.

Now suppose that a continent should rise up in that part of the ocean, wherever it may be, that suppli«
the clouds with the vapor that makes the rain for this Lake water shed ; What would be the result? Wh
surely ‘a change os climate in the lake country3 aa increase of evaporation from it, because a decrease'ospre
cipitation upon it, and consequently a diminution of cloudy screens to protect the waters of the lakes fro1
being sucked up by the rays of the Sun; 3ηά consequently‚ too, there would follow a low stage for wate1
courses; and a lowering of the lake level would ensue. ⁷

So far, Ϊ have used'the lakes only hypothetically‚ that 1 might the better illustrate the bearing's of th
question with which I set out, viz: Where have the subsidences and the elevations taken place, that hav
madean inland basin here, 3ηά another there? Is the seat of this action near by, or sar off ; and what iiaw
the winda had to do in cutting off the sea :irainage of inland water-sheds?

But in this hypothetical case, with regard to the hydr ographical basins of the Gulf 3ηά Lakes, Ι have confine«

mysell' strictly to analogias, Mountain tanges have been upheaved across the course of the windS‚ and continent:
