atmospherical contact and radiation, is one of the causes which move the isotherm of 600 from its J anuary to
its September parallel.

It is well to consider another of the causes which are at work upon the currents in this part of the ocean,
and which tend to give the rapid southwardly motion to the isotherm of 600.

We know the mean dew point must always be below the mean temperature of any given place ε and that
consequently, as a general rule at sea, the mean dew point due the isotherm of 600, is higher than the mean
dew point along the isotherm of 500, and this again higher than that of 400—this than 300, and so on.

Suppose‚ merely for the sake of illustration, that the mean dew point for each isotherm be 50 lower than
the mean temperature, we should then have the atmosphere which crosses the isotherm of 600, with a mean
dew point of 550, gradually precipitating its vapors until it reaches the isotherm of 500, with a mean dew
point of 450. ΒΥ which difference of dew point the total amount of precipitation over the entire zone be-
tween the isotherms of 600 and 500 has exceeded the total amount of evaporation from the same surface.

Now, as a general rule in the Atlantic ocean, and it may be inserted in the Pacific also, the prevailing
direction of the windS, to the North of the 4oth parallel of North latitude, is from the southward and west·
ward, in other wordS, it is from the higher to the lower isotherms ; passing, therefore, from a higher to a lower
temperature over the ocean, the total amount of vapor deposited ΒΥ any given volume of atmosphere, as it is
blown from the vicinity of the tropical towards that of the polar regionS, is greater than that which is taken
up again. How the land may modify this position is another question. I speak of the rule at sea, not of the
exceptions on the land.

Now, then, these investigations have brought out prominently before us the fact, that there is near the

tropice, both of Cancer and capricorn, a belt of calms across the great oceans. That on the equatorial side

of these belts, the winde at the surface of the sea blow permanently towards the equatbr—i. e.‚ they come
from a cooler and go to a warmer region ; thus increasing their capacity for 'moisture, and consequently taking
up more vapor in this part of their circuit than they precipitate down upon it again.

On the polar side of these calm belts of the tropics, the prevailing direction of the wind on the surface of
the ocean is towards the poles—i. e.—-from a warm to a colder temperature3 and therefore in this part of their
circuit these winds must deposite more vapor than they can take up again.

These sacta, though they be not new, yet they are pressed by the charts so forcibly upon uS‚ that w‘e are
led irresistibly to the theoretica] conclusion that the trade-wind regions of the ocean are the evaporating
regione, and that as a general rule in all other regions of the world, except the deserts, and a few otherS,
mostly on the land, the evaporation is less than the precipitation, and that the excess is returned ΒΥ the rivers
⁸ and the rains in the shape of currents from towards the poles to the evaporating regions of the Torrid Zone 3—
and that the total amount of rain and river water discharged into the sea, without the limits of the evaporating
region, expresses the volume by which the cold currents exceed the warm currents os the sea—designating as
cold cun-enta all those which run into the Torrid Zone ; and all those as warm, which bring their waters from it.

These charts indicate that upon the ocean, the area comprehended between the isotherms of 400 and 500
