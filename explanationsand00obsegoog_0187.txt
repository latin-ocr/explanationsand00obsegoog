“ Suu—I avail mysels of an opportunity of sending a letter-bag by the ‘⁴ PrometheuS,” to forward my
report of our deep sea soundings since J uly, 1851.

On leaving Pensacola in November last, Ι required from the Naval Storekeeper 40,000 fathoms of line
and 12 leadS, which had been sent there for the purpose of continuing these experimentS.

On the 2d December, being in latitude 240 25’ North, longitude 830 23’ West, bottom was found with
1531· fathoms line; time running, 23 minutes 29 secondS. Drift, at the rate of a mile an hour. Temp. air
710, temp. water 800. Ι was much pleased to find the line of excellent quality.

December loth, 1851.—1n latitude 270 04’ North, longitude 790 44’ West, a sounding was got with 380
sathoms line; time of running, 4 minutes 51 secondS. Temp. air 740, temp. water 800.

The same day having changed our latitude to 270 16’ North, longitude 790 49’ West, we repeated the
experiment, and got bottom with 274 fathoms line ; time of running, 3 minutes 24 seconds. Temp. air 780,
temp. water 790. This result being unexpected, the operation was immediately repeated, and bottom was
got with 284 fathoms line; the same running time and temperature.

Having made up my mind to get several casts across the Florida stream, so as to make sure of the greatest
depth at this part of its course3 I was very much disappointed in finding myself upon the western side of the
channel, as the soundings proved conclusively.

The wind was too light to enable me to get back into the middle part of the stream, and 1 was reluct-
antly compelled to relinquish my design.

The error in our position can be easily accounted for, by the fact that we were from 6 P. M. of the 8th,
beating about in this narrow pass and rapid stream, without observationS, or being able to get hold of any
landmark. Near sunset of the same day, I ordered another cast to be taken, which gave bottom at 440
sathoms; time of running, 5 minutes 47 secondS. Latitude 270 55¹ North, longitude 790 45’ West. Temp.
air 730, temp. water 790.

On the llth December, 1851, in latitude 270 51’ North, longitude 790 09¹ West, bottom was got with
670 fathoms line; time of running, 11 minutes 49 secondS. Temp. air 780, temp. water 760. Drift, one
mile an bour. At sunset of the same day, 1 renewed the experiment, and found bottom with 631 sathomS.
l regar-d this sounding as perfectly accurate, every circumstance being favorable3 latitude 270 34’ North,
longitude 70⁰ 54' West. Time of running, 9 minutes 38 secondS. Temp. air 75⁰, temp. water 760.

On the 12th December, 1851, got bottom with 690 sathoms line; time of running, 10 minutes 22 sec-

ondS. Latitude 270 19’ North, longitude 770 18Ι West. Temp. air 780, temp. water 760. Nearly calm,
no drist.

At sunset the same day, having changed our latitude to 270 10’ North, longitude 760 59¹ West, got

another cast, and found bottom with 1180 fathoms line; time of running, 24 minutes 29 secondS. Temp. air
