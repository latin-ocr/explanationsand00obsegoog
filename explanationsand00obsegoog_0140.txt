there. Now is not this one of those modifications of climate, which may be fairly traced back to the effect of
the saltness of the sea in giving energy to its circulation?

Moreover, if there be a deep sea in the Polar basin which serves as a receptacle sor the waters brought
into it by this under current which, because it comes from towards the equatorial regionS, comes from a milder
climate, and is, therefore, warmer, we can easily imagine why there might be an open sea in the Polar regions;
—wby Lieut. De Haven in his instructions was directed to look for it; and why, both he, and capt. Penuy of
one of the English searching vesseIS, found it there.

And in accounting for this Polynia, we see that its existence* is not only consistent with the hypothesis with
which we set out touching a perfect system of oceanic circulation, but that it may be ascribed, in a great degree
at least, if not wholly, to the effect produced by the salts of the sea upon the mobility and circulation of its waterS.

Here then is an office which the sea performs in the economy of the universe by xirtue of its salmess, and
which it could not perform were its waters altogether fresh. And thus philosophers have a clue placed in their
hands which will probably guide them to one of the many hidden reasons that are embraced in the true answer
to the question, ‘⁴ why is the sea salt ?''

But we find in sea water other matter besides common salt. Lime is dissolved by the rains and the rivers,
and emptied in vast quantities into the ocean. Out of it, coral islands and coral reefs of great extent—marl beds‚
shell bankS, and infusorial deposits of large dimensionS, have been constructed by the inhabitants of the deep.

These creatures are endowed with the power of secreting, apparently for their own purposes only, solid
matter which the waters of the sea hold in solution. But this power was given to them that they also might
fulfill the part assigned them in the economy of the universe. For to them, probably, has been allotted the im·

portant office of assisting in giving circulation to the ocean, and of helping to regulate the climates of the earth.

The better to comprehend how such creatures may influence currents and climateS, let us suppose the ocean to·
be perfectly at rest 3——that throughout, it is in a state of complete equilibrium 3-that, with the exception of those
tenants of the deep which have the power ofextracting from it the solid matter held in solution, there be no agent in
nature capable of distributing that equilibrium 3-and that all these fish, ἀφ, have suspended their secretioris in
order that this state of a perfect aqueous equilibrium and repose throughout the sea, might be attained.

In this state of things—the waters of the sea being in perfect equilibrium—a single mollusk or coralline,
we will suppose, commences his secretionS, and abstracts from the sea water, solid matter for his shell. In
that act, this animal has destroyed the equilibrium os the whole ocean3 for the specific gravity of that portion
of water from which this solid matter has been abstracted is altered. Having lost a portion of its solid con·
tentS, it has become specifically lighter than it was before3 it must, therefore, give place to the pressure which
the beavier water exerts to push it aside and occupy its place, and it must consequently travel about and
mingle with the waters of the other parts of the ocean until its proportion of solid matter be returned to it,
and until it attains the exact degree of specific gravity due sea water generally.

How much solid matter does the whole host of marine plants and animals abstract from sea water daily?

Is it a thousand pounds or a thousand millions of tons? No one can say. But whatever be its weight, it is so
