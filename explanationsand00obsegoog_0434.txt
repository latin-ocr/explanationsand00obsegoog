doubt that it is in about 290 20'* and not 280 20'. With regard to your chartS, allow me to say I think very
highly of them. Ι crossed the equator in about 30Ο in 263 days from New York, after losing my tiller and
being thereby detained 16 hours with a strong fair gale. Ι passed to the windward of Noronha‚ cleared St.
Roque and St. Augustine, and the first time I tacked ship from Ncw York was south of Rio‚ which I passed
in less than 37 dayS, with a very deep ship. Passed through the Straits of Lo Maire in 60 and Cape Horn in
less than 61 dayS. After that I had miserable chanceS. Having been nearly 20 years a ship·mastcr‚ and hav·
ing, during my passage, given the subject much consideration, Ι will venture, at the risk of being thought
presuming, to state my own views on the passage from Cape Horn to this port. Being up'with Cape Horu, Ι
would improve all opportunities of making westing‚ with very little regard to Latitude‚ except to keep clear
of the land, till in Long. of 800 W. then, if wind permitted, edge off very gradually to the N. and shape my
course so as to be in the Long. of 110Ο W„ in about 300 S. Lat. ; here you may expect to get the S. Ε.
trades 3 and then make a due North course till I took the ,Μ Ε. trades. My reasons are that you would thus
make your westing where the degrees are short, and then oross the entire S. E. trades on a course that would
let all your canvass draw‚ instead of running so much before the wind as to becalm your head sails. You
would thus take the N. Ε. trades in about 1100 W„ which is as far East as is desirable. You will see by the

Log that the ‘doldrums' did not detain me much on either side.’'
