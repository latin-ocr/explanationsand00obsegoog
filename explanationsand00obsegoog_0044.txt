of calms and their limits sor every month in the year determined; the course, bifurcation limits, and other

phenomena of the Gulf stream have been more accurately defined, and the existence of almost equally remark-
able systems of currents in the Indiau Ocean, on the coast of China, and down the west coast of America and
elsewhere has been' ascertained. There are, in fact, very few departments of the science of Meteorology and
Hydrography which have not received very valuable additions ; whilst the most accurate determination os the
parts of the Pacific ocean (which are very limited in extent) where the sperm whale is found 3 as well as the
limits of the range of those of other specieS, has contributed very materially to the success of the American
whale fishery, one of the most extensive and productive of all the fields of enterprise and industry.

‘⁸' The success of this system of co·operative observation has already led to the establishrnent of societies
in Bombay and Calcutta sor obtaining by similar means, a better knowledge of the windS, the currentS, and
the course os the streams os the Indian Ocean.

‘⁴ But itis to the government of this country, that the demand for co·operation, and for interchange of
observationS, is most earnestly addressed by the Government of the United States; and the President and
Council of the Royal Society express their hope that it will not be addressed in vain.

“ We possess in our ships-of·war, in our packet service, and in our vast commercial navy, better means
of making such observationS, and a greater interest in the results to which they lead, than any other nation;
sor this purpose every ship which is under the control os the Admiralty, should be furnished with instruments
properly* constructed and compared, and with proper instructions for using them: similar instructions sor
making and recording observationS, as far as their means will allow, should be given to every ship that saiIS,
with the request that they will transmit the results of them to the Hydrographical Offisg of the Admiralty,
where an adequate staff of officers or others, shall be provided for their prompt examination, and the publica-

tion of the improved charts and sailing directionS, to which they lead: above all it seems desirable to establish

a prompt communication with the hydrographers of the United States, so that the united labors of the two

greatest naval and commercia] nations os the world may be combined, with the least practicable delay, in pro·

moting the interests ot* navigation.

“The President and Council refer to the documents which have been submitted to them, and more
especially to the explanationis and sailing directions to accompany wind and current chartS, prepared by Lieu·
tenant Maury, for a more detailed account of this system of co·operative observatione, and os the grounds
upon which they have ventured to make the preceding recommendation8.''

Moreover, at the last meeting of the British Association, held a few weeks ago, its President in his address
remarked: “ The activity which has prevailed so greatly of late, in the collection of Meteorological data, has
been almost exclusively confined to that portion of the surface of the globe which is occupied by land, although
the portion covered by the ocean, is not only much greater in extent, but is also better suited for the solution
of several Meteorological problemS.

‘⁴ Many striking examples might be adduced to show that it is systematic direction, and not individual

zeal, in naval men which has been wanting, and ithus been therefore, with· great satisfaction‚ that Meteorologisls
