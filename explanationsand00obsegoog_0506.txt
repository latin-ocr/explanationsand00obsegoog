More about the Australicm and other pass-oyes in the PactJfic-—vide pp. 464, etc.

The United States and Australia are antipodal. A diameter of the earth having one end in the Atlantic
upon the parallel of 380 N. at its intersection with the meridiati of 350 W. would have the other near Port
Philip, New South WaleS. It will therefore be perceived how that the meridians of many places in Amerina
being followed to the South Pole, and thence onward, would guide one to various places in New Holland.

Thus the same meridian line which passes through Eastport in Maine, being continued on the other side
of the world, will be found to pass near the Swan river settlement os the great Gold Continent.

This meridian is a great circle, and it therefore represents the shortest distance between any two places
that are situated upon it.

Hence it will be perceived that the great circle from New York to Australia passes very nearly through
the axis of South America‚ thence south through the Antarctic regionS, and so on northwardly again till it
reaches this modern Ophir.

But this route is impracticable to the navigator, and it is therefore useless to give him sailing directions
for it.

Let uS‚ however, look sor one which being practicable will be found to deviate as little as possible from the
great circle, and which, moreover, all things being considered, offers to vessels in the Australian trade from
‘Europe as well as from the United States, the fairest prospect of the most speedy passages. Having found
such a route, Ι propose to give those navigators, whether American or European, who are cooperating
with me in collecting data for my rese-arches, the benefit of additional sailing directions for Australia, or
at least such further suggestions with regard to the passage as 1 at present see] prepared to make.

As the great circle from New York to Port Philip passes through South America, and as the land
blocks the way so that ships cannot go west of that meridiam we must look to the eastward of it for the most
practicable route.

Cape St. Roque and Port Philip may be considered for all our present purposes to be actually, as in
reality they nearly are, on the same meridian. To find the great circle distance between two such places, we
have but to add the co·latitude of one to the co·latitude of the other, and their sum gives what is sought.
Thus the co·latitude of the St. Roque is 840 32', and of Port Philip 510 41', the sum of which is 1360 13'.

It will suit the purposes of illustration better to count from the equator in the Atlantic at its intersection
with the meridian of St. Roque (350 24') from which point the great circle distance to Australia is 8‚501
miles,

Now all ships, whether from North America or Europe that are bound into⁴ the southern hemisphere are
advised to cross the line to the eastward of 350 24', (west.) Therefore this great circle is not yet far enough
to the eastward for the navigator. Suppose, then, the average crossing place in the Atlantic to be, as it nearly
is, in 300 west: let us start the great circle from this point. From this crossing to Port Philip, the most remote

parallel touched by the great circle, is about 840 S. near its intersection with the meridian of 600 Ε., and the
distance to Australia is 8‚482 miles.
