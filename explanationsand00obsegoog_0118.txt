neighboring region, and calls to his aid the forces of elevation and depression which are supposed to have
resided in the neighborhood: he then points to them as the agents which did the work. They are mighty
agents, and they have diversified the surface of the Earth with the most towering monuments of their power.
But is it necessary to suppose that they resided in the vicinity of this region? May they not have been, if not
in this case, at least in the case of other inland basina, as sar removed as the other hemisphere? This is a

question which I do not pretend to answer definitively. But the inquii-y as to the geological agency of the

winds in such caseS, is a question which my investigations have suggested ; and Ι therefore present it as one
which in accounting sor the formation of this or that inland basin, is worthy, at least, of consideration.

Is there any evidence that the annual amount of precipitation upon the water-shed of the Dead sea, at
some former period, was greater than the annual amount of evaporation from it? If yea, where did the vapor that

supplied the excess of that precipitation come from, and what has cut off that supply? The mere depression
of the lake bed would not do it.

If there were ever a river from the Dead sea to the arms of the ocean about it, we may imagine that river to
have abounded with falls, as the rivers do which drain the North American lakes into the Atlantic. ⁴ And if
we establish the fact that the Dead sea did ever send a river to the ocean, we carry along with it the admission
that when that sea overflowed into that river, then the water that fell from the clouds over the Dead sea basin
was more than the winds could convert into vapor and carry away again; the river carried off the excess to
the ocean.

In the basin of the Dead sea, in the basin of the Caspian‚ of the sea of Aral, and in the other inland
basius of Asia, we are entitled to infer that the precipitation and evaporation are at this time exactly equal-
Were it not so, the level of these seas would be rising or sinking. If the precipitation were in exceSS‚ these
seas would be gradually becoming fuller3 and if the evaporation were in· excess, they would be gradually
drying up3 hut observation does not show, nor history tell us, that either is the case. As sar as we know,
the level of these scas is as permanent as that of the ocean, and it is diffie-ult to realize the existence of sub-
terranean channels between it and the great ocean. Were there such a ohannel, the Dead sea being the lower, it
would be the recipient of ocean waters3 and we cannot conceive how it should be such a recipient, without
ultimately rising to the level of its feeder.

It may perhaps be evident that the question suggested by my researches has no bearing upon the Dead
sea3 that local elevations and subsidences alone were concerned in placing the level of its waters where it is.
But is it probable that, throughout all the geological periodS, during all the changes which have taken place in
the distribution 'of land and water surface over the earth, the winds, which in the general channels of circulation
pass over the Dead sea, have alone been unchanged? Throughout all ageS, periods and formation8‚ is ἱῐ
probable that the winds have just brought as much moisture to that sea as they now bring, and have just
taken up as much water from it as they now carry off? It is possible. But because the agency of the winds
may have had nothing to do in placing the level of the Dead sea where it is, does it therefore follow that the

consideration of this question would be irrelevant in the attempt to account for the level of the water reservoir

of other inland basius?
