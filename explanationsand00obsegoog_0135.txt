This then is one of the sources whence power is given to the system of oceanic circulation ; but though
a feeble one, it is one which exists in reality, and therefore, need not be regarded as hypothetical.

Let us next call in evaporation and precipitation, that we may examine the effects of another and a

more powerful agent. Suppose the evaporation to commence from this imaginary fresh water ocean, and to go on
as it does from the scas as they are. In those regions, as in the trade wind regions, where evaporation is in
excess of precipitation, the general level of this supposed sea would be altered, and immediatelyas much water
as is carried off by evaporation would commence to flow in from North and South towards the trade-wind or
evaporating region, to restore the level.

On the other hand, the winds have taken this vapor, borne it off to the extra-tropical regions and

precipitated it, we will suppose, where precipitation is in excess of evaporation. Here is another alteration of
sea level ΒΥ elevation instead of by depression3 and hence we bave the motive power· for a surface current from
each pole towards the equator, the object of which is only to supply the demand for evaporation in the trade wind

regions—demand for evaporation being taken here to mean the difference between evaporation and precipita-

tion, or the quantity of water that is taken up into the air and carried, in the form of vapor, to other parts as before,
from the trade wind region.

So far, we only derive from evaporation und precipitation over the supposed fresh water sea, a slight
surface current towards the equator, and, of course, we have the forces for but a partia] oceanic circulation.

The motive power os such a current would be gravitation, acting upon an inclined plane.

So far in the progress of illustration we have apparent counteraction3 for we have, on one hand, the sea
level lowered in the equatorial regions by evaporation, and raised by the expansive force of beat on the other;
we have also the sea-level‘oi the Polar regions raised on one hand by precipitation, and lowered on the other
by the contraction due the diminution of temperature there. But this counteraction is only apparent, for the
increase of temperature about the equatorial, and the decrease of it about the Polar regions can only produce a
certain effect, which, like the effect of the centripedal force upon the figure os the Earth, in elevating the sea-
level at the equator, becomes constant, and which like every other constantjn nature, is compensated; whereas
the process of evaporation and precipitation being continued, the difference of level created by these in differ·
ent parts of the ocean is accumulative and not constant. It, therefore, remains for currents to restore.

We have now traced from their principles of action the effect of two agents, which in a sea of fresh water
would tend to create currents, and to beget a system of aqueous circulation3 but 3 set os currents and a system
os circulation, which, it is readily perceived, would be quite different from those which we find in the salt sea.
One of these agents would be employed in restoring, by means of one or more Polar currents, the water that is

taken from one part of the ocean ΒΥ evaporation, and deposited in another by precipitation. The other agent

would be employed in restoring, ΒΥ the forces due difference of specific gravity, the equilibrium, which has
been disturbed by heating, and of course expanding, the waters of the Torrid Zone on one hand, and by cool-
ing, and consequently contracting‚ those of the Frigid Zone on the other. This agency would, isit were not
