Now, if we suppose the current which runs into that sea, to average from mouth to head 20 miles a day
-and this is conjecture merely, but for the purpose of illustration also—it would take the water fifty days to
reach the head of it. If it lose two tenths of an inch from its surface, by emporetica, it would appear,
that by the time it reached the isthmus of Suez, it would have lost ten inches from its surface.

Thus the waters of the Red sea ought to be lower at the isthmus of Suez than they are at the straits of
Babelmandeb. They ought to be lower from two causeS‚ viz: evaporation and temperature——for the tempera·
ture of that sea is necessarily lower at Suez, in latitude 300, than it is at Babelmandeb, in latitude 130.

To make this quite clear3 suppose the channe] of the Red sea to have no water in it, and a wave ten feet

high to enter the straits of Babelmandeb, and to flow up its channel at the rate of twenty miles a day,
for fifty dayS, losing daily, by evaporation, two-tenths of an iuch; it is easy to perceive that at the end of
the fiftieth· day this wave would not be so high, by ten incheS‚ as it was the first day it commenced to flow.

The top of that sea,·therefore, may be regarded as an inclined plane, made so by evaporation.

But the ⁴salt water, which has lost so much of its freshness by evaporation, becomes salter, and, therefore,
heavier. The lighter water at the straits cannot balance the heavier water at the isthmus, and the colder and
salter‚-and therefore, the heavier water must either run out as an under-current, or it must deposit its surplus
salt in the shape of crystaIS, and thus gradually make the bottom of the Red sea a salt bed3 or it must abstract
all the salt from the ocean—*and we know that neither the one process nor the other is going on. Hence we
infer that there is from the Red sea an under or outer current, as from the Mediterranean through the straits of
Gibraltar. Analysis would probably show the 'surface waters at the head, to be salter than those near the mouth
of the Red sea, and it is hoped that some of my fellow laborers in the Red sea trade, will collect specimens of
its waterS, and afford us an opportunity of testing them.

And, to show why there should be an outer and under current from each of these two seaS‚ letus suppose
the case of a long trough, opening into a vatos oil, with a partition to keep the oil from running into the trough.
Now, suppose the trough to be filled up with wine, on one side of the partition, to the level of the oil on the other.

The oil is introduced to represent the lighter water, as it enters either of these seas from the ocean, and
the wine the same water, after it has lost some of its freshness by evaporation, and, therefore, has become

salter and heavier.'

 

the winda are which blow upon this sea at this season os the year, we may suppose the daily evaporation to be immense 3--no less, ⁰01·
tainly, than half an inch, and probably twice that amount. We know that the waste from canals by evaporation in the summer time is
an dement, which the Engineer, when taking the capacity of his feeders into calculation, has to consider. With him it is an im·
portant element ς how much more so must the waste by evaporation from this sea be, when we consider the physica] condition· under
which it is placed ; its feeder, the Arabian sea, is a thousand miles from its head—its shores are burning sanda—the evaporation is eccm·
less ‚· and none os the vapor's which the scorching winda that blow over it, carry away, are returned to it again in the shape of rain!-

The Red sea vapors are carried off and precipitated elsewhere. The depression in the level of ita head waters in the summer ‘ime’
therefore, it appears to rne, is owing quite as much to the effect of evaporation a? to the effect of the wind in blowing the waterss bssssk
from it into the ocean. Analysis will probably show the surface water at the head, and the deep sea water at the mouth to be salter» ²¹²⁶
therefore heavier, than are the surface waters at the mouth os the Red sea.
