As attaching further interest to this route and these westerly winds of the Southern hemisphere, and
also as throwing new light upon the subject before us, Ι quote from 3 recent official letter to the Secretary
of the Navy:

Numam. Onssnvmomr,
Washington, May 10, 1853.
“Sat—The clipper ship “ Sovereign of the SeaS‚” MeKay, has made such an extraordinary run, that 1

beg to make it the subject matter of an official report. It is due to builderS‚ ownem, and masters, as well

as to navigation‚ that such an achievement should be made known.
