The action of the Sun upon these unequally absorbing and radiating sur-faces in and behind, or to the north-
ward os'the N. E. trades probably tends to retard these winds, and to draw large volumes os the atmosphere
that otherwise would be moved by them, back to supply the partial vacuums made by the beat of the Sun, as
it pours down with active intensity, its rays upon the vast plains of burning sands and unequally heated land

surfaces in our overheated hemisphere. The N. W. winds of the southern, are stronger than the S. W. winde

of the northern hemisphere.

The charts shows that the influence of the land upon the normal directions of the wind at sea, is an im-
mense influence. It is frequently traced for a thousand miles or more out upon the ocean.

For instance: the action of the Sun’s rays upon the great deserts and arid plains of Africa, in the summer
and autumnal month8‚ is such as to be felt nearly across ‘the Atlantic ocean between the equator and the par-
allel of 13ο North. Between this parallel and the equator, the trade winds are turned back by the heated
plains of Africa, and are caused to blow a regular southwardly monsoon for six months.

This monsoon is a discovery which has been fully and completely developed by the charts and the inves-
tigations connected with them. They (the monsoons) blow towards the coast os Africa from June to Novem·
ber, inclusive. They bring the rains which divide the season in these parts of the African coast. The region
of the ocean embraced by the monsoons is cuniform in its shape, having its base testing upon Africa, and its
apex streaching over ’till within 10Ο οι· 150 of the mouth os the Amazon.

. Indeed, when we come to study the effecte of South America and Africa, (as developed by these charts,)
upon the winds at sea, we should be led to the conclusion—had the foot of civilized man never trod the interior
of these two continents—that the climate of one is humid3 that its valleys are for the most part covered with
vegetation which protects its surface from the Sun's rays3 while the plains of the other are arid and naked;
and for the most part act like furnaces in drawing the winds from the sea to supply arr sor the ascending

columns which rise from its overheated plainS.

Pushing these facts and arguments still further, these beautiful and interesting researches seem already
sufficient almost to justify the assertion, that were it not for the Great Desert os Zahara and other arid plains
of Afric-a, the western shores of that continent within the trade wind region would be almost, if not altogether,
as rainless and sterile as the desert itself.

These investigations, with their beautiful developments eagerly captivate the mind3 giving wings to the
imagination, they teach us to regard the sandy deserts, and arid plantS, and the inland basins of the earth, as
compensations in the great system of atmospherical circulation. Like counterpoises to the telescope, which
the astronomer regards as incumbrances to his instrument, these wastes serve as make-weights, to give cer·
tainty and smoothness of motion 3—facility, and accuracy to the working-s of the machine.

The meteorological and physical researches with which the “ wind and Current Charts'' are connected,
relate only to the sea. Already the mariner has selt and acknowledged the importance of them. Commerce

and navigation are reaping benefits from them of great moment. The merchants of Bombay and American
navigators, with that regard sor the practica] and useful which adorna their character and makes them renowned,
