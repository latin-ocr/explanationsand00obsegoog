cmcULATloN OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 97

Having descended‚ s' is forced out on the equatorial side of the zone, and appears on the sur-sace as Δ —-
the N. Ε trade winds—ssand so continues until it reaches the belt of equatorial calmS.

Here then is precipitation, an ascent of atmosphere‚ and a fall os the barometer; Δ now becomes ὅ or an
upper current flowing in a S. E. directim—i. e., from N. W. towards the zone of the calms of Capricorn.
Here it is met by the upper current from the Antarctic regionS, descends with a rise in the barometer again,
and appears on the polar side os this zone os calmS, as ια’-1113 prevailing N. W. surface winds in the extra-
tropical regions of the southern hemisphere.

A' now approaches the Antarctic regions in a spiral, gyrating with the hands os a watch and contracting
its convolutions as it draws nearer and nearer the pole, where theoretically there is another atmospherical node

in which A' ascends with a low barometer‚ and commences its return towards the equator as δ’ in the upper

regions of the atmosphere.

The same cause—diurna] rotatim-'which made the A' on the sursace to approach from the N. W.‚ now

operates to make it return as δ’ in the direction whence it came.

Arriving in the upper regions ‘at the calm zone of Capricorn ὅ meets ἅς the two descend, and δ’ continues
to flow towards the equator as A'‚ the S. E. trade wind.

Arrived at the zone of equatorial calms, it ascends, and continues thence in the upper regions of the
atmosphere as δ”, until it reaches the calm zone of Cancer. Here it descends, and continues on as the S. W.
passage winds of the northern hemisphere, whose circuit has been already described.

Thus, at the risk of repetition and of being thought tedicus, I have described the progress which investigatione
connected with the Wind and Cui-rent Charts had enabled me to make in the theory of atmospherical circula-
tion3 and I bave presented that theory as far as it had been developed in my own mind, when Ι received
yesterday No· 1, vol. i, 4th series, of the London, Edinburgh‚ and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and
Journal os Science, containing a synopsis of Dr. Faraday's “ Experimental Researches in electricity‚'’ 24th
25th‚ 261h‚ and 27112 series3 and also the letter of Prof. Von Feilitzsch on the Physical distinction ‹ffMagneh'c
ond Diamagmtic Bodies.

This account, though meagre, is the first account that I have seen of the Doctor’s discoveries relative to
the magnetism of the atmosphere.

A new era in our knowledge of the laws‚ and the agents concerned in the general system of atmospherical
circulatim, will probably be dated from these discoverieS.

With the accounts of them before me, Ι feel somewhat in the condition os the tempest·tossed mariner who

has been buffeting with the waves in storm, cloud8‚ and darkness, until he feels himself almost bewildered and

lost in the mist that surrounds him3 when suddenly a light appears, and, like the grateful mariner, 1 wished,
before taking a fresh departure, to bring up my reckoning, and to ascertain how sar 1 was out, in order to show
how great was the service rendered by the sympathising hand which put forth that light.

Dr. Faraday has shown that, as the temperature of oxygen is raised, its paramagnetic soree diminishes‚

being resumed as the {e3mperature falls again.
