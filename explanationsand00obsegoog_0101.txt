Wind from any point of the eastern half of the horizon will bring rain generally, aster blowing twelve

 

hours. It frequently happens that we have winds in a dry time to blow much longer, even several days, from
that direction, without rain3 but on the wind’s shifting to the opposite side, we are sure of rain. 1 think our
rains during summer come most frequently from the 8. Ε. Wind from the S. W. is generally accompanied
by good dry weather. West and N. W. are dry. 1 have notioed that thundcr and lightning in the North is
almost invariably followed here by storms of rain and hard winds within twelve or twenty-four hours.

My farm is on an alluvial prairie plain,(probably formed by the washings os the Missouri and Mississippi)
six miles below St. Charles.

ΤΙιε apple is our main dependence. Peaches also flourish finely; as do plums, cherries, (except the
blaclr‚) strawberries‚ gooseberries, wild and cultivated. Whest and corn are the principal productions.
Timothy hay will soon be exported from our neighborhood to a considerable extent. 1 cultivate wheat and

corn almost exolusively.

 

These answers, as far as they go, show that the 8. W. winds-the winds suggested by the charts—are,
except in lVestern Missouri, the rainy winds. These winds‚ like those between the same parallels upon the
ocean, are going from a higher to a cooler temperature 3 and these winds in the Mississippi valley, not being
in contact with the ocean, or with any other evaporating sur-face to supply them with moisture, must bring the
moisture with them from some sea or another.

Theresore‚ though it may be urged, inasmuch as th'e winds which brought the Patagonia rains came
direct from the sea, that they therefore took up their vapors as they came along; yet it could not be so urged
in this case3 and if these winds could pass with their vapors from the equatorial calms through the upper
regions of the atmosphere to the calms of Cancer, and then as sursace winds into the Mississippi valley, it was
not perccived why the Patagonian rain winds should not bring their moisture by a similar route. These last
are lrom the N. W.‚ from warrner to colder latitudes; therefore, being once charged with vapors they must

precipitate as they go, and take up less moisture than they deposit.

This was circumstantial evidence. No fact had yet been elicited to prove that the course os atmospherical

circulation suggested by my investigations is the actual course in nature. It is a case in which 1 could yet

hope for nothing more direct than such conclusions as might legitimately flow from circumstantial evidence.
