terrens raon wantum. 315

But (as 1 tell them alt) with the Whale Chart before them,they would have the united experience of more
'than fifty yearS, as to the wherembouIS, and probable locality of whaleS.

And as sperm oil is by far the most valuable of their ca‘tchingS, they would protract their passage but little,
by steering through the thickest of the whales, as laid down upon the chart, till they reach the latitude of 40
or 50 South, then westward to meridiari of the Sandwich lslands before crossing the equator3 the loss of time
would be nothing, when compared to‘ t-he more than probable prospect of taking sperm oil.

While writing of sperm whaleS, whose history Ι like to dwell on, I would mention a rather mysteriouS,

end to uS, (old whalers) singular phenomenon, in regard to their remaining under water, or in any event, out
of sight of those cruising for them, for days and weeks together3 and when found—I mean the large males,
(or bulls as they are called)—either alone, in shoals·‚ or with the cow3, their lieads are lacerated and covered
with scarS, and deep old ulcerS, evidently caused by fighting one another. This conclusion is obviouS, from
the regularity ofthe two lacerated lines, such as would be drawn by the two tows of teeth they have, and the
distance apart of the old ulcerS, just such as their teeth would be likely to inflict. This is remarked by alt
whalers, and corroborated by my long experienee. If they fought on the surfac-e, should we not find theit-
wounds bleeding? If their wounds were recently inflicted, would they not have that appearance?

There is much doubt entertained here, whether the right whale‚ (or Bowhead‚) as those are called, found
in Japan and Ochotsk seaS, in Anadir Bay, Behr-ing’s Straits and Arctic Circle, is the same as those found iu
Davis’ Stxaits and Baffin’s Bay.

Capt. Alyn, of ship “ Rodman,'' on a recent voyage, while at the Sandwich IslandS, saw a Capt. Hasagen

who commanded the “ Clemanteen,'' a Bremen whaler3 said captain „had been whaling two seasons in Japan
and Ochotsk seas; he had also been two voyages whaling, this side, in Davis' Straits and Baffin’s Bay3 he
noticed a marked difference about the head, and thought them a separate species of the right whale3 the heads
of the Bowhead whale of the.Arctic region, being entirely smooth‚ having nb protuberance or crown, in which
barnacles are thickly and deeply i‘mbedded, as are those found in Bsffia’s Biy, South Atlantic, and South Pacific.

Meser. Perkins and Smitb, are owners of ship “ McLellan,’' of New London, now on her second voyage
whaling in Baffin’s Bay and vicinity. I have written those gentlemen to make the inquiry of Capt. Perkins
or any leading offiuer that might be at hand, as to the different organization (if any) as above. They kindty
replied to my note, by stating‚ that no means were at present attainable to gratify my curiosity, but they were
expecting the “ McLellan’' home soon, when they would make the investigation sought, and again write me.

All the evidence I can give in regard to 3 water communication from Behring’s Straits to Baffin’s Bay
side, is: that Ι have caught and eaten at the Aleutian Islands, and at Katntscltatka, the same halibut,· codfish‚
berrings and salmon, that are caught from the waters that wash the coast of these New England States t—and
that 1 have caught, or tried to catch, fish along the Pacific coast from Chiloe to Kamtschatka,—from thence
along the western Pacific,-—-often at the island8,—at New Zealand, and at Van Dieman's Land,—and have

never found either of the kinds of fish above mentioned.¹¹¹¹

 

⁸1 have understood that oodfieh are to be caught in great quantities at the island of Juan F'ernandez. But captain McKenzio
think· the suh caught. in euch quantitien there are not cod, and that my informant was nienhem—M. F. M.
