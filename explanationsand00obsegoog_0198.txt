pose of carrying on these experiments. We required the whole supply, and took it on bpard, supposing that
we shall be able to consume it, before our term of service expireS. The line has a beautiful appearance and
we find no knots in it, the different lengths having been carefully joined at the rope-walk. It has also been
waxed, and marked at every hundred sathoms. I regret‚ however, that so much trouble should have been
thrown away in making it, sor we are obliged to mark it over again, as there was no description of the marks
sent with it, and in deep soundings we should always have been in doubt as to the tlzousands. I would suggest
that in future the line should have some simple and conspicuous mark inserted at each hundred sathomS, with·
out attempting to designate the hundreds, or the thousand-5, leaving that to be done on board the ships, in their
own manner. But, if a caresul description of the marks should accompany each reel, the plan os marking
at the rope-walk would be a better one; and as it would save trouble on board ship, you would be likely to
secure more soundingS. I do not like the manner of marking adopted in this line. There is too great a
similarity between the nine hundred and the thousand mark3 each is a simple end of silk, in one case is taken
round the line and in the other stuck through it. We find th³e measurement very exact.

Ι have been thinking of a plan to carry out the suggestion contained in your letter of the 25th April, of
timing the descent of each hundred sathoms, and 1 think 1 have hit upon one likely to succeed. At the
hundred fathorns mark, we attach a narrow strip of white cotton cloth, three or sour inches long to the line,
the ends being stuck between the strandS. This can be easily seen as it passes out3 and as soon as it becomes
wet, it will lie close to the line, and add little or nothing to the friction. Upon these rags, we place our
own marka, whose order of color, δια, are caresully noted in a book kept sor the purpcse.

ed December, 1851.—We are improving the time, by preparing our line for use whenever we may arrive
at a spot not yet visited by us, The Captain is very desirous to give you some more casts in the Florida Pasti,
where we shall probably be very soon.

1 send you the following memoranda, supposingthat you may find them valuable in comparing the sound-
ings by our new line, and those by the old, when using the 32 lb. shot3 and in comparing the results os the
new line, as afforded by the 32 lb. {hou and the new sounding lead. I refer os course to the. time of descent,
and the consequent influence os any under current upon the line.

lst—The Καὶ) It is obvious that when the diameter of the reel is increased by being full os line, it will
revolve more sreely than when the line is nearly run out, and the radius shortened. The account os every
experiment, hereafter, will be preceded by a statement os the quantity of line on the reel. The latter is made
like the ordinary log reel, except that the ends of the iron rod, serving as the axis, rests upon a wooden
support or frame3 they are always kept well oiled. It is two feet in length between the inner sides·ot‘ the
dises forming tlte ends; it is six incbes in depth from the outer edges of these discs to the upper part of
the wooden bars upon uhic-h the line is reeled 3 and this point, is three incbes from the ·centre os the

axis, When filled up square and even the reel contains 12‚000 fathoms of the new line.

 

⁸ Lieut Taylor afterwards found reason to change the opinion expressed above, he says ε instead os turning more easily from the
increased length of lever, when full, the great weight upon the axis produces so much friction, that it revolves more sluggish1y‚ and we
have to help it along by hand. The weight‚ therefore, will have to be considered when investigating the ratio of descent.
