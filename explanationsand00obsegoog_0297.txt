Here the bottles would‘ separate, one following the Lagullas current around the Cape of Good Hope into
the Atlantic.

The other taking the other branch of the stream, would be drifted to the southward of New Holland, and
be carried into the Antarctic regions near Victoria land. Here the current being cooled down and deflected, it
would commence its flow towards the North as the icc-bearing current which flows into the Atlantic around
Cape Horn,-the icebergs of which Ι have encountered in latitude 370 South. Bottles that have been thrown
overboard off Cape Horn, have been picked up, on the shores of Ireland.

However, without pursuing just now this system of currents pointed out by the bottles and the whales, and
suggested by the dynamical forces imparted by the salts of the sea to its cur-rents, Ι propose at another time a still
further investigation and account of these beautiful and interesting facts which the Whale Charts are developing.

After Lieut. Herndon was called away, the investigations for these charts were continued by Lieut. Leigh
for Ξ short time. His duties were soon changed, and Ι remained without force to resume the work, till late
in 1850, when Lieut. Fleming reported for duty. ί He was set to work on the “ Whale Chart8,” but before
he had made any progress with them worth the name, he was detached and ordered on other duty. Passed
Midshipman Jackson then took them in hand, and completed them.

They show in what part of the ocean the whales “use” in each month, and the knowledge cannot fail
to prore of great importance to the whaling interests os the country,-an interest which keeps in continual
occupation a fleet of 600 sail, manned by 15,000 American seamen—-and which fishes up annually trom the
depths of the ocean, property, the real value of which far exceeds that of the gold mines of California.

Plate IX exhibits an extract from the Whale Chart.

The object of these charts is to show where the whalemen have hunted, and where they have found their 3..-
game3 consequently, this chart enables us to designate those parts of the ocean where the whales “ use,’' and
those parts where they never go—and to tell where in each month this animal is most likely to be found.

The three horizontal lineS, Plate IX, marked D. R. S., in the middle column, repeated from parallel to
parallel, stand: D. for days3 R, and S. for the number of dayS, each, on which whales, Right or Sperm, have
been seen. The days of search are expressed in figures; the days on which whales are seen are expressed
by the system of “ fives and tallies‚‘’ as already explained with regard to the winds, ι

It will be observed, that from-600 North, to 600 South, between the meridians of 1250 and 1300 W„
right whaleS, except in one instance, have never been reported by any of the vessels whose Logs have been
examined. That sperm whales except a straggler or two, have never been seen between these meridiana,
and below 50 S.; between which parallel and the equator they are most abundant. That they are seen
between 350 and 500 N; between the equator and 100 N.; but not between 100 and 350 N.; and the
inserence is drawn from the fact of their appearing so frequently between the parallels of 350 and 500 N., that
warm water is found there.

The investigations for this chart are so conducted as to show the years in which the whales have been
searched for and seen in the various districts of the ocean. These results are the embodied experience of

several hundred whalemen as to the best fishing grounds.
