“ As the Sun sunk, the scene changed into another about as rich and novell The clouds gradually
turned to chocolate‚ and the ground work to cream, which lightened in tone upwardS.

“ Again : the zenith next was purple, which merged below into crimson, this into pink‚ and this into a
light and dead yellom, which touched the narrow band at the horizon—now between cinereus and slate.
Clouds varying in figure and magnitude, floated over this gorgeous ground work, all of deep umber, and their
lower sides showing edges of red, more or less vivid.

“ January 15. Latitude 100 27¹ N ., Longitude 290 W. At 11 A. M„ the Sun again obscured by adark
brown cloud of moderate size,beneath which adrab curtain stretches out, bordered with a wide cinerous hem below.

From the concealed orb, white and creant tinted streame descend, producing a soft and singular contr-ast with
the bright blue and green grounds above, with their light floating masseS.

“ In the asternoon another rich gronam work of cream appeared, and upon it a numerous flock of choco-
late fleeces, au edged with white and silver--a glorious picture. The day's drop-scene was almost as ravish-
ing as that of yesterday‚ exhibiting much the same colors but differently disposed. A few particulata may give
artists an idea of its character. The zenith blue, vanishing into greenish white, and thence into vivid white
at about half-way down the vauit, then a light cream tint commenced and continued increasing in depth ff tone
to the ribbon of alate at the horizon. Words are wanting to describe the richness of this cream below, its
delicacy above, and purity throughout. The Sun was about 8Ο above the horizon, glowing as yesterday like
an eye os molten gold between eyelids of deusest jet.

‘⁴ Six or seven degn-ees above him lay adark brown fleeoe not less than200 in length and 4Ο in depth, and
but for some patches resembling dark tortoise shell, might be called a raven black. In front of this, shot up
from the orb a san of rayS, and a similar'one opened below him. Each did not exceed a sextant or sixth part
of a circle. Their effect, relieved and modified as they were, by the different colored media, was of course,
indescribable. Thau, on either hand, and au above, were seen single clouds of varying forms and sizes—
au of a rich chocolate hue. Their under sides being darkest, and edged with silver. Those lowest were
deeper toned than those above. Their longer axes were inclined to the depazrting luminary, and mov-ed after
him, as if hastening to bid him good night.

’“ l thought these cream colored soenes might be named Qualcer aleier, for here the heavens in their love-
liest costume, not only sanction, but adopt the very hues that pretty sisters of the sect prefer. Can George
Fox, Wm. Pena, or other voyaging patriarcha of the Friends‚ while on missions over seas, have received

their canonica! colors immediately from above? Caught the idea and inspiration literally from the clouds?
“ J anuary 16. Latitude 70 44¹ N., Longitude 280 31³ W. The red duat obviously accumulating ,- one of

the foresails-—an old one—looks as isit had received a coat of light brick colored paint, so much and evenly has
the dust collected on it. We are opposite Seni-Gambia and Soudan, which border on the great desert,
whence the Captain thinks the shower comes. He sent a man alost to collect specimens for me, but after
several ineffectual trials, Ι sent up a sheet of foolscap paper, which he rubbed over the sail, and sent it down
coated over with a light reddish or pale-brick colored tint. The particles are so minute, and adhere so fismly

to the villous nap, that no other way occurred to me to obtain them.
