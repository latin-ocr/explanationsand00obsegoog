the object of the present plan. Theresore, the men of science, the scientific societieS, the ship owners and
ship masters, the directors of corporationS, and the faculties of universitieS, and the members of the various

institutions sor the promotion of science, and good men everywhere, are requested to lend this scheme their

good will, their influence, their aid, and their co-operation.

The importance of concert among Meteorologists all over the world, and of co·operation between the
observer on the shore and the navigator at sea, so that any meteorological phenomenon may be traced throughout
its cycle both by sea and land, is too obvious sor illustration‚ too palpable to be made plainer by argument.
And therefore the proposition sor a general conference to arrange the details of such a comprehensive system
of observationS‚ addresses itself to every friend of science and lover of the useful in all countrieS.

The domain of this science is the atmosphere: its boundaries embrace the land and cover the sea. To

comprehend the laws which govern the movements of a machine so vast as it is, requires that its operations

should be observed in all its partS, and watched from all points at the same time. Its motions are freer and less

. obstructed over the water than they are by the land and across the mountains Indeed, the ocean itself may,

in one sense, be regarded as agrand expression osmeteorological agencies; therefore the good-willand friendly
‹zo-operation of private ship-owners and masters, in all maritime countrieS, is considered of great importance
to the cause in hand.

Many os these in Amet-ica have already shown their willingness to enter this field as co-laborerS. Several
hundreds of them are already co-operating with me in a system of observations according to a prescribed form,
and srom which several highly important resultS‚ both practical and scientific‚ have already been obtained.
Itis presumed that the ship-owners and masters of other countries will be equally as willing, and equally as
zealous to second and to take part in such a system os observations as those of America have shown
themselves to be.

These observatione at sea possess a double value: they help uS, as do those on the land, to a right
understanding of the meteorological machinery of the earth3 and they also help us in the sase navigation of
the seas and in the industrial pursuits of commerce.

By how much the commercial marine of every country is more extensive than its naval, by so much

“ more valuable is the assistance which the former is capable os rendering. ’ How far are the owners and masters

of the private ships under the various flagS, inclined to furnish their vessels with the necessary instruments—to
use them—to record the observations all according to the same form—and at the end of each voyage, to
transmit them to the Repository that may be designated to receive them?

Upon the answer which the sea-faring community of each nation, shall give to this question, depend the
importance os the aid, and the value of the co·operation which they will render in this undertaking. If they
will but unite in one‘long pull together, the ocean, at their word, may be covered with floating observatorie8‚
each one, without interruption to owners or inconvenience to master, propounrling as he goeS, the same
questions to nature3 and all of them may, at the same instant, though scattered over the whole sace of the
earth, be extracting and recording her answers thereto.———These answers when brought together, compared and

sifted‚ cannot fail to reveal truths and principlesof the highest interest to mankind.
