all the great rivers of China; and in North America, in the latitude of the Caspian sea, is our great system
of fresh water lakes ε all of these receive from the atmosphere immense volumes of water, and pour it back into
the sea in streams the most magnificent.

It is remarkable that none of these copiously supplied water-sheds have, to the southwest of them in the
trade wind regions of the southern hemisphere‚ any considerable body of land: they are, all of them, under the ‚
lee of evaporating surfaces, of ocean waters in the trade wind regions of the South. Only those countries
in the extra-tropical North, which Ι have described as lying under the lee of trade wind South America and
Africa, are scantily supplied with rains. Pray examine Plate IV in this connection.

The surface of the Caspian sea is about equal to that of our lakes z in it evaporation is just equal to the
precipitation. Our lakes are between the same ραι-311318, and about the same distance from the western coast

os America that the Caspian is srom the western coast of Europe: and yet the waters discharged by the St.
Lawrence give us an idea of how greatly the precipitation upon it is in excess of the evaporation. To wind·
ward of the lakeS, and in the trade wind regions of the southern hemisphere‚ is no land 3 but to wind·
ward of the Caspian sea and in the trade wind region of the southern hemisphere‚ there is land. Therefore,
supposing the course os the vapor-distributing winds to be such as 1 maintain it to be, ought they not to carry

more water srom the ocean to the American lakes, than it is possible for them to carry from the land—from

the interior of South Africa and America—to the valley of the Caspian sea?

In like manner extra-tropica] New Holland and South Africa have each land—not water——to the wind·
ward of them in the trade wind regions of the northern hemisphere‚ where, according to this hypothesis, the
vapor for their rains ought to be taken up: they are both countries of little rain3 but extra-tropical South
America has, in the trade wind region to windward of it in the northern hemisphere‚ a great extent of ocean,
and the amount of precipitation in extra-tropica] South America is wonderful. The coincidence, therefore, is
remarkable, that the countries in the extra-tropica] regions of this hemisphere‚ which lie to the northeast of
large districts of land m the trade wind regions of the other hemisphere‚ should be scantily supplied with
rains3 and likewise that those so situated' in the extra· -tropical South, with regard to land in the trade wind
region of the North, should be scantily supplied with rains.

Having thus remarked upon the coincidence, let us turn to the evidences of design, and contemplate the

beautiful harmony displayed in the arrangement of the land and water, as' we find them along this conjectura!
“ wind-road.” Plate IV.

Those who admit design among terrestrial adaptations, or have studied the economy of cosmical arrange·
ments, will not be loth to grant that by desig-n the atmosphere keeps in circulation a certain amount of moisture:
that the waters of which this moisture is made are supplied by the aqueous surface of the earth, and that it is
to be returned to the seas again through rivers and the process of precipitation3 that a permanent increase or
decrease os the quantity of water thus put and kept in circulation by the winds would be followed by a
corresponding change of hygrometrical conditions, which would draw after it permanent changes of climate ; and
that permanent changes of climate would involve the ultimate well-being of myriads of organisms, both in

the vegetable and animal ltilnegdoms.
