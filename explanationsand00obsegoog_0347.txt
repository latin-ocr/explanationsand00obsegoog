Lat. 280, before keeping off 3 my object in doing this is that the wind here generally prevails from the north-
ward and eastward, and that the current generally sets to southward and eastward, which greatly facilitates the
passage aster rounding the Tortugas with the wind from the eastward, 1 have generally beat down on the
Florida side, knowing that the strongest current prevails onssthat shore, unless too close in. From Carrysfort
Reef to Mantanilla 1 have always endeavored to keep in the centre of the stream. During all my voyages 1
have made it a rule to steer from Mantanilla to Lat. 290, N. by W„ 8ηά then North to Lat. 31Ο before hauling
'7 up N. E. by N. ; by 8ο doing 1 have, with a few exceptionS‚ kept the strongest current. On' some other occa·
sions 1 have hauled up on a N. E. by N. course when in Lat. 300, Long. ’79Ο 40⁹, and have soon found my·
self on the eastern edge of the Gulf. 'After rounding Cape Hatteras it is advisable to keep to the westward,

especially in the winter season, on account of the prevailing westerly winds.''

 

Sciling Directionssor tloe Coatzacoalcos river— Capt. Foster, of tlte ‘⁸ Alabama,” to Lieut. Maury.

“ Sailing vessels bound for the Coatzacoalcos ought to make the land to the eastward. This precaution
is necessary on account of the prevailing trade winds which cause a strong westerly current; also in case of
a norther‚ to have the advantage of sea-room. The entrance to the river may be known by the vigia or tower
situated upon the western side; likewise from the 88ηά cliffs extending from that point to the westward.

The best mark for crossing the bar is to bring the tower' to bear S. ἒ W. by compass. Having passed
the bar haul up to the East of South, and steer in midway between the two points that form the entrance to
the river. The wind, after crossing the bar, often falls to calm3 for this reason it is necessary to have 88
anchor ready to let go, as the current on the ebb, even in the dry season, sets out strong.

The extent of the bar, East 8ηά West, is about 220 fathoms, and the wldth, by actual measurement, 108
feet. The bottom composed of 88ηά 8ηά clay is hard, on which account it is not liable to shift. It forms in
hard northerly gales‚ a narrow barrier of breakers‚ and cannot be crossed without imminent risk. The depth
at high water on full 8ηά change is about 13 feet, 8ηά falls as low as 10 ⁸ feet. The general depth, however,
is 12 feet, from which it suddenly deepens to 5 or 6 fathoms.

Except in heavy weather, there prevails a regular land and sea breeze. The latter sets in between the
hours of 9 Α. M. and noon.
