Careless navigators in slow sailing vesseIS, may try these routeS, fall to leeward, and bring them into dis·
repnte. To prevent this, it is a matter of great importance that their practicability should be tested by sair
sailers, under skillful navigators. ᾗ

You will therefore perhaps encourage the hope that the Department will, at an early day, find it convenient
to avail itself of the authority granted by congress, and detail two suitable vessels of the Navy for the purpose
of trying these tontes, and of co-operating with the “ Taney” in making those other observations which are
required to assist me in the construction os these chartS, and which are necessary to perfect them.

lt is well known that the route to every port in the Pacific, Indian‚ and South Atlantic Oceans, is the same
as far as the equator 3 and indeed until Cape St. Roque in Brazil, be cleared.

1t is also well known that this common part of the route varies according to the season of the year.

Since the first publication of the “ Wind and Currant Charts‚’' the materials sor improving them have in·
creased with great rapidity. These materials have been so discussed and arranged by the officers at the Ob·
servatory that, with the aid of the “ Pilot Chart,'' the navigator may now calculate and project the path of his
ship on an intended voyage, very much in the same way that the astronomer determines the path of a comet
through the heavens. There is this difference, however ε the chart with its data shows the navigator that, in
pursuing his path on the ocean, head winds and calms are to be encountered, which will turn him aside or re-
tard him on his way; and that therefore he cannot predict with certainty the place of his ship on a given day.
He, therefore, in calculating his path through the ocean, has to go into the doctrine of chauces, and to deter-
mine thereby the degree of probability as to the frequency and extent with which he may anticipate adverse
winds and calms by the way. -

Thus in the 5 degrees square of the ocean, between latitude 350 and 40Ο Ν., longitude 700 and 750 W„
the log books of 4,387 vessels, or the records of vessels for 4,387 days in this square, have been examined3
323 of which were there in the mouth of February of different years.

Now supposing (and there is no reason to suppose otherwise) that these observations give a fair average
as to the prevalence of calmS‚ and the direction of the winds: we are led to the conclusion that if one of these
vessels had attempted to sail through this square one hundred times on an Ε. S. Ε. course, in the month of
February for a series of years, she would have had 6.2 calms, fair winds 85.5, and 1.3 wind dead abead or at
E. S. E.; that she would have been headed off on the larboard tack, or by “ slant '’ winds from the northward
and eastward 7.3 times 3 and on the starboard tack‚ or by “ slant '² winds from the southward, 5.9 times.
