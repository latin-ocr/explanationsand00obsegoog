A UMVERSAL sYSTEM001? ΟΒ8ΕΒῩΔΤῙΟΝΒ. 15

“ 'l'hough Ῑ have published very little on meteorology for want of time to put the stock os information 1

have collected in order, I have beside me an enormous mass of facts. Three years since 1 began to perceive
that we had certain classes of storms that occurred periodically, not only all over India, but all over the region
to which my info'rmation emended, and that these were synchronous or nearly so; I then began a series of
maps illustrative of the matter. 1 have sent you specimenS, but for this we were too scantily provided with
information. Instrumenta] observations are too much insisted on, when excellence is not attainable they are
better dispensed with: the remarks of an observant man, recorded at the time, with due advertence to day
and honr, are invaluable. Surely these might be had in abundance for the future, if not for the past. This
you will observe, is intimately connected and in perfect consonance with your theories of the electric or mag-
netic origin of all meteorological phenomena.

“ Through this means alone can the occurrence of storms simultaneously round the one half of the world be
acco unted for. Have you any good sets os hourly barometric observations from your southern States? If
you will turn to the London Philosophical Transactions os 1850, you will see a paper by Colonel SykeS, on
the observations made in India, which will show you the interest attaching to barometrical tides, within and
beyond the tropicS, and we are most anxious to discover the law they obey till they become merged, and to a

’great measure lost in, vast casual fluctuation8.” ⁹ '¹' ⁶

 

About the same time 1 had the pleasure to receive a letter from C. Meldrum, Esq., Secretary of the Meteor·
ological Society of MauritiuS, manifesting the same friendly spirit on the part of that Society, and offer-ing to
do in aid of our undertaking whatever might be done at that important meteorological station. This kind

offer was gladly accepted, and Mr. Meldrum was requested to have copied at the expense of the Observatory

the abstract logs os vessels arriving at Mauritius.

In the mean time Kupffer, the laborious meteorologist of Russia, had suggested the idea of a conserence
between the meteorologists os Russia and those os the United States, with a view to a more general co·operation
and concert of action between them3 while this subject was under advisement, a proposition was made by the
British Government that that of the United States should-competate with it in its plans sor making meteorological
observations at certain foreign stations, and according to instructions that had been prepared by direction of
Major General Sir John Burgoyne, Inspector General of FortificationS. Here was an opportunity unexpectedly
offering itsels sor establishing concert of action among meteorologists on shore, and co·operation among
navigators at sea everywhere, in collepting data and materials sor the advancement of science and the benefit os
navigation. I could not suffer such an opportunity to paSS, and therefore, in reply to the British proposition
suggested th‘at the sea should be included as well as the land, that the plan should be uniform and universa13 ’
and that in order to make it so and to secure its succeSS, l ventured to propose a general conference, to consist
among others of meteorologists from the shore and of navigator-s from the sea, who should take the subject up

and discuss the planS, draw up the forms, fix the standards and prescribe the instruments to be used, the instruc· .

tions to be followed3 in short a confereuce that shall take cognizance of everything whether it have regard ⁸

to the instruments and their errorS, the subjects to be observed, the methodS, formS, δια, of reduction-
