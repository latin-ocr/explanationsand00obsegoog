Three observations make a day; 80, in order to see how many days of observation have been discussed
for any rnonth, it is necessary to divide by three the number which stands in the column for the months and on
the line marked “dayS.'’

The object os this chart was to show the exceptions to what may generally be considered the prevailing
condition os the weather at sea, and to determine from what quarter storms are most liable to occur for each
month in every district.

It may be that mariners do not always record in their logs rain, sog, thunder: or lightning. They do
always mention gales and calmS, and the quadrant whence the wind blows: It may, therefore, be probable
that both rains and lightning occur at sea more frequently than it would appear by the charts they· do 3 if 80,
1 have at present no means of knowing. But it may be presumed that mariners generally are not more apt to
neglect to mention rainS, thunder and fogS, in one part of the ocean than the other, and that therefore, the
relative frequency with which they occur may be supposed to be fairly indicated on the chart.

But as the chart is a fair exponent according to the data from which it is constructed, as to the frequency
of the phenomena to which it relateS, we are bound to give it as much saith and credit in one respect as in
another, and therefore, to assume until we have reason to suppose it otherwise, that the occurrence of rain,
fogs and lightning, is fairly represented in point of frequency.

The scores designate not the times that it thunders or rainS, or blows a gale, but simply the number of

days on which such phenomena have been reported to occur3 as an example, a gale may be accompanied with

sog and rain, thunder and lightning, in which case a score would be made in the appropriate places sor each. ⁸

The districts represented in Plate III by A, B and C, extend from 30Ο N. to 45Ο and from 550 W. to
600 W. Those represented by D, E and F. extend from the equator to 150 N., between the meridians of 250
and 300 W. ἡ

This plate also affords matter that is interesting to sailor philosophers.

Examining district F, it appears that rains and calmS, and N. W. gales abound from December to May
inclusive. That lightning is never seen, nor thunder heard there from April to September, inclusive 3—that

in October there is an occasional gale from the eastward 3 and that from June to September may be called a

rainless season, during which period there is rarely a calm and never a gale, nor a thunder cloud to disturb
the air.

This is because the equatorial calms and their train of atmospherical disturbances have gone up, as shewn
per trade wind chartS, into district Ε. The rainy season in E is the dry one of F; It may bf said that E has
two rainy seasonS, one⁰for about 2} months betore August, the other for three months after.

1t appears from D, that the rains commence before the calms and continue after them ε that from Deccm-
ber to March is a rainless period: and that an electric display from the clouds is a rare occurrence at any time
of the year in this district.

Now going to A, the first thing that strikes us is the prevalence of fog8‚ the regularity of precipitation,
