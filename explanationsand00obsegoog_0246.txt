FIG. 1--PLATE XV.
Vertical section qf the slope and basin qs the North Atlantia.

This diagram was constructed to show roughly the elevation os the earth’s crust above the sea level, from
the Rocky mountains across the Mississippi valley to the Atlantic, and thence the depression of its solid crust
below the sea level, across the ocean to the shores os Europe. This section is near the parallel os 390 N.

The section showing the elevation above the sea level of the surface of the land from the Rocky moun·
tains to the Atlantic, is taken from Dr. Drake’s work on “ The principal diseases in the interior valley of North
America,” and the section showing the depression os the bed os the ocean below the sea level, is taken from
the deep-sea soundings upon which plate XIV is based.

This section confirma the conjecture which these deep-sea soundings suggested soon after they were com·

meneed‚ and which was mentioned in former editions of this work, viz: That the bottom of the sea is proba-

bly much more rugged and abrupt than the surface of the dry land.

Reasons why such should be the case are obvious: ou the land, the wiuds, the rains and rivers are always
drifting and washing down the high places and filling up the low: these agents are not felt at all, or, if selt,

felt but seebly at the bottom of the deep sea.
On the dry laud, frosts and the-force of gravity are great levellerS. At the bottom of the deep sea no

frosts are felt, and the difference of the force of gravity operating upon a rock at the bottom of the sea, and
upon the top of a mountain, is as the difference in weight between airand water.

Both of these platea, however, though Ι do not claim sor either of them any minute degree of accuracy,

are *suggestivffi

Barometric Anomalies about the Andes.

Lieutenant Herndon, U. S. N., in his descent of the AndeS, on his way in 1851-’2 from Lima to explore

the valley of the Amazon, and to descend that river to the Atlantic, determined the heights os various places
above the level of the sea, both by Barometric pressure, and by the boiling point of water. His boiling appa·
ratus was constr-acted by Mr. Wm. Wurdemann, os this city. s

His observatione as to atmospheric pressure, made with the view of determining heights above the sea
level, appear to indicate that the form or shape os the Andes is repeated in the atmosphere. In other words,
that there is in the region of the clouds, a ridge or pile of atmosphere, answering to an air-cast mould os the
Cordilleras ; for at the eastern base of the Andes he found the pressure os the atmosphere, as measured by the
temperatum of boiling water, to be nearly as great as it is usually at the sea level—and that aster having de-
scended the river for nearly a thousand miles below thia · place of great pressure, he found that, according to

the boiling point, he had ascended nearly 1,500 feet!
