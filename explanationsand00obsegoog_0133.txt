then shall we account sor this, unless upon the supposition that sea water from one part of the world is in the pro-
cess of time brought into contact and mixed up with sea water from all other parts of the world? Agents there-
fore, it would seem, are at work which shake up the waters of the sea as though they were in a bottle‚ and
which, in the course of time, mingle those that are in one part of the ocean with those that are in another as
thoroughly and completely as it is possible for man to do by shaking them in a vessel 'of his own con-
struction.

This fact as to uniformity of components, appears· to call for the hypothesis that sea water which to-
day is in any part of the ocean, will, in the process of time, be found in another part the most remote. It must
therefore be carried about by currents; and 33 those currents have their offices to perform in the terrestria] ἢ
economy, they probably do not flow by chance, but in obedience to physical laws; they no doubt therefore
maintain the order and preserve the harmony which characterize every department of God’s bandy-work upon
the threshold of which man has yet been permitted to stand, to observe or to comprehend.

And thus by a process of reasoning, which is perfectly philosophical, we are led still further to conjecture
that there are regular and certain, if not appointed channelS, through which the water travels from one part of the
ocean to another and that those channels belong to an arrangement which may make, and for ought we know to the

contrary, which does make the system of oceanic circulation as complete, as perfect, and as harmonious as is that

of the atmosphere or the blood. Every drop of water in the sea is as obedient to law and order, as are the members
of the heavenly hostin the remotest region of space. For when the morning stars sang together, “the waves also
lifted up their voice„ in the Almighty anthem; and doubtless therefore, the harmony in the depths of the ocean

is in tune with that which comes from the spheres above. we cannot doubt it. For were it not so, were there

no channels of circulation from one ocean to another, and if accordingly the waters of the Atlantic were confined
to the Atlantic, or if the waters of the arms and seas of the Atlantic were confined to these arms and sear», and had
on channels of circulation by which they could pass out into the ocean, and traverse different latitudes and
climates, then the waters of these arms and seas would, as to their constituents, become in the process of time very
different from the sea waters in other parts of the world.

For instance, take the Red sea and the Mediterranean by way of illustration ; upon the Red sea there is
no precipitation. It is in a rainless regiam not a river runs down it ; not a brook empties into it; therefore
there is no process by which the salts and washings of the earth which are taken up and held in solution by rain or
river water, can be brought down into the Red sea. The air takes up from it in the process of evaporation
fresh water, leaving behind all the solid matter which the sea there holds in solution.

On the other hand, numerous rivers discharge into the Mediterranean ; some of which are filtered
through soils and among minei-als which yield one kind os salts or soluble matter; another river runs
through alimestone or volcanic region of country, and brings down in solution solid matter, it may be common
salt, sulp-hate or carbonate of lime, magnesia, soda, potash or iron, either or all may be in its waterS. Still the
constituents of sea water from the Mediterranean, and of sea water from the Red sea, are quite the same. But

the waters os the Dead sea have no connection with those of the ocean: they are cut off from its channels of
