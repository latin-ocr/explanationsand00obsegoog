“ Having had long experience in the trade between New York and New OrleanS, I herewith furnish you
with a few remarks 011 wind and currents. For the last six years I have commanded the ship Vicksburgh, con-
stantly trading between these two ports. In making the passage out, after passing the Hole-in-the-Wall, 1
ha've frequently found a current from 1 10 3 miles per 110111, Setting to the eastward through the northwest chan-
1101 of Providence, particularly aster the wind 1138 prevailed from the westward a few dayS. This, no doubt,
has been the cause of putting a number of vessels on shore among the Berry IslaridS. I have latterly made it
a point to take the last bearings of the light on the Hole-in-the-VVall, and either haul up or keep off as Ι found
the current; generally running on a West course until quite down with Little Stirup KeyS, then steering W. by
N. ᾗ Ν., by compass if in the night, until I was up with the Great Isaacs. The last three voyages having reached
the vicinity of the Little Isaacs in the day time. I have hauled in on the Bank between the western Little
183308 and the East Brother Rock, and steered S. W. by W., by compaSS, which has brought me out in good
passing distance from the Moselle shoal—during one of my summer passages out, after passing the above 811031
l was compelled to anchor and remained there for six dayS, the wind during all this time was light from the
southward, and I could not help remarking the regularity of the current setting along the Bernini IslandS, ebb
and flow, about two miles per hour; this continues as sar as Gun Key, when it is broken off by the Guls which
sets close into the Key. From this point up to Orange Key‚ when close in, little or no current is experienced
except the ebb and flow, which is directly off the Bank. In crossing the Santaren channel the current is gov-
erned greatly by the winds; with strong southerly winds the current sets about N. N. W., two miles per hour;
on the other hand, with strong northerly windS, little or no current is felt. After leaving the Double-Headed-
⁴ Shot Key, I have generally hauled over sor the Florida Rees, and in the day time kept close in, when 1 have
frequently found an eddy current setting to the westward from 1 10 1} miles per hour. After passing the
TortugaS, 1 have invariably felt 3 southerly current until Ι had reached the Long. of 840 30¹ W., and even further
than this at 1111108, 38 will be seen by referring to my journaIS, particularly in November, 1848. Returning

from New Orleans, Ι have always made it a point to keep to the westward until 1 had reached the Long. 850,
