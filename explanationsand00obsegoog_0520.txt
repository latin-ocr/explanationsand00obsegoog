The course of this elever navigator from July 18th to 24111, proves what I say. The “ Helena'’ was
aiming for the usual track around the Cape of Good Hope. She did not take the fork in the route, 1ο which

run down with the winds on her quarter upon a S. S. E. course or there away, until she got the “ Westerly
TradeS‚’' the northern verge of which she found J uly 29th3 that is, ll days after losing the S. E. TradeS‚ and
near the parallel of 380 South.
