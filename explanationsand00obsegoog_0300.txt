water3 they go to such bays only where the water is blue and deep, and under the lee of islands and reefs—
the bays at the great island of Albemarle, of the Gallapagos group, is often visited by large shoals of cows
for that purpose—the water in those bays is of great depth, and as blue 38 the Gulf Stream.

Ι have said that squid is the ‘only article of their food. 1 am aware that others think differently;
that they do eat other fish. 1 can only judge from what 1 have seen. After a sperm whale is mortally

wounded, and is in his last struggle, he not unfrequently throws up the contents of his stomach 3 which in the
hundreds of instances Ι have seen, 1 have never discovered any thing but parts of squid. In cutting them up
also, 1 have often opened the stomach‚ and never noticed any thing but squid; hence 1 infer, that squid is
their only food.

Their great object of migrating from place to place is no doubt in search of food ; they are often seen in
large bodies moving quicldy, all in one direction3 by getting their course as they paSS, and following on after
them, 'in a few dayS, again meet them brought tc, feeding and laying quite still, and headed in different direc-
tions.. In this case, the whaler often succeeds in getting a large share of oil before they are so harrassed and
cut up as to compel them to abandon the ground.

1 have osten thought that currents had much to do with the movements of sperm whales ε and as they are
most always found heading it where it is 'strong, Ι have thought it was to meet the bait brought down with
the current, particularly near the equator in the Pacific, where a current is always found setting to the west·
ward, which grows stronger as you proceed westward, and· the whales generally found stemming it, headed
to the eastward. ’

Ι have spoken of the timidity of sperm whaleS. Ι have known instances near the land, where sperm
whales were laying entirely still, a seal to spring in among them, and start them to running with great vio·
lence. Ι have also known them started and set running by the approach of porpoiseS.

It is remarked by many experienced sperm whalers—-though Ι never noticed it very particularly myself,

except in large whales—that after rising to the surface from their deep submarine explorationS, they would '

breathe or spout as many times as they will yield barrels of oil. How this rule works with small whale8‚ 1
never noticed ; but Ι do know that those we rank as large whales, yield from fifty to one hundred barrels,—
do when undisturbed spout from fifty to one hundred times; as a general rule, they spout from sixty to seventy
timeS, and yield when taken, from sixty to seventy barrels of oil.

Large Sperm whales remain submerged in search of food, from an hour to an hour and a half, which 1
presume is as long as they can hold their breath, for when they rise (unless disturbed or making a passage)
lay quite still 38 if breathing was the ostensible object.

That sperm whales do perambulate the whole ocean, Ι have no doubt. Instances are known of their-
being harpooned on the J apan coast, and disengaging themselves srorn the boat, have afterwards been taken
on the coast of Chili3 this was known by the ship’s mark on the harpoon. One instance is known where a
sperm whale was thus struck on the coast of Peru, and subsequently, taken off the coast of the United States.

Ι have often met sperm whales off the Cape of Good Hope, and off Cape Horn, making their passage
from sea to sea. ’
