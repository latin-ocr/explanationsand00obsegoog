deep at the straits, the bottom ¹of t'he sea to be a perfect level thence to Suez, it would require no lead a1
nor chemist to tell us that the depth os the Red sea at its head was just 18 feet, and that the water he
just twice as much salt in it as the water at the strait has. Now the water at the straits could not balan«
brine. The brine is the heavier, and out it must flow as an under current, as exemplified by the illustr
with regard to the water and oil in a trough, p. 56.

It probably does not take the water more than 60 days on the average to reach the head of the Re
aster first entering it. In that case, the annual evaporation being 18 feet, the difference of level would
feet, and this estimate is probably not far wrong.

Thus the conditions with regard to the Red sea, vax: higher level, and an under current at the Stra
Babelmandeb‚ are theoretically established with just as much certainty as we might expect to find salt ε
bottom of it, were the mouth to be closed and all the water now in it to be evaporated.

With regard to the under current from the Mediterraneaa, and which under current is caused by sil
agencies, an early idea as to its existence was owing to the following circumstances, as giren in a paper
the currents at the straits mouth,”by Captain , , communicated by Dr. Hudson tofhe Philosop]
Society, 1724. “

“ It is very remarkable,” continuesthat remarkable paper, ‘⁶ that inthe year 1712, Mons. du L'Aigle‚

 

fortunate and generous commender of the privateer called the Phoenix ‚of Marseilles‚ giving chase near C
Point to a Dutch ship bound to Holland‚ he came up with her in the middle os the gut between Tariffa
Tangier, and there gave her one broadside which dinectly sank her, all her men being saved by Mons.
L’Aigle 3 and a few days after, the Dutch ship with her cargo os brandy aad oil, arose on the shore 1
Tangier‚ which is at least 4 leagues to the westward os the place where she sunk, and directly against
strength of the current3 which has persuaded many men, that there is a recurrency in the deep water in
middle of the gut that sets outward to the grand ocean, which this accident very much demonstrates3 ε
possibly a great part of the water which runs into the straits returns that way, and along the two coasts bet
mentioned: otherwise this ship must of course have been driven towards Oueta, and so upwards. The wa
in the gut must be very deep3 several of the commanders of our ships of war having attempted to sound
with the longest lines they could contrive, but could never find any bottom.''

In 1828, Dr. Wollaston, in a paper before the Philosophical Society, stated that he found the speci
gravity of a specimen of sea water from a depth of 6⁹70 fathoms, 50 miles within the straits, to have a “ dens
exceeding that of distilled water by more than 4 times the usual excess, and accordingly leave8‚ upon evap

ration, more than 4 times the usual quantity of saline residuum. Hence it is clear, that an under-current οι
ward of such denset water, isos equal breadth and depth with the current inward near the sufface, που

carry out as much salt below as is brought in above, although it moved with less than one-fourth part of tl

velocity‚ and would thus prevent a perpetual increase of saltness in the Mediterranean sea, beyond that exis
ing in the Atlantic.’'

The Doctor obtained this specimen of sea water from a captain in the English navy, who had collecte
