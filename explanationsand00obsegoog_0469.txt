According to all these Calisornia passageS, and the results which they show, it appears that it is possible
ior a vessel under canvass to make the run from New York to San Francisco in 85 dayS. And it does not
appear that there has ever been a combination of circumstances. and a succession 01 winds which would have
made it possible sor any vesscl to have done this more than once or twice in the last three years, If the “ Ftying
Cloud,’' or the “ Sword Fish‚'' after crossing the line in the Pacific had met with the winds which the “ white
Squall’' had thence to San FranciscO, she would have made 1116 run in 85 dayS. Eighty-five (lays may 116 re-
garded, therefore, as the shortest “ combined’' passage, and as the minimum limit of possible passages from
any one 01 1116 Α1133116 ports of the United 813163. 11 13 therefore, we may infer, within the range 01 proba·

be made in less time.
