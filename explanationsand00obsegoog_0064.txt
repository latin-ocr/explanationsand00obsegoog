serve, in my opinion, to swell the current down from Baffin's Bay through Davis' Straits into the Atlantic.
How does all this water escape from this ocean again, is the question?

T hat there is an open water communication, sometimes at least, from Behring’s Straits to Baffin’s Bay,
has been all but proved by the results of investigations undertaken about two years ago, at the National Ob-
servatory, with regard to the habits, migrationS, etc., of the whale.

These researches were commenced at this office by Lieutenant Hammon, and they were conducted
in such a manner, as to show by a glauce at the chart, in what parts of the ocean, and in what months of the
year, whales had and had not been seen.

These investigations soon led to the discovery, ,that to the right whale, the equator is as a wall of fire—
that that animal is never found near it, seldom or never within a thousand miles of it, on either side.

This fact induced me to inquire of the whalemen, whether the right whale of the northern and the right
whale of the southern hemispheres was the same animal.

The answer was “ No.’' The right whale of the latter region, as described by these men, is a small pale
animal, the largest scarcely yielding more than fifty barrels of oil. Whereas, that of the northern region is a
large dark animal, yielding frequently to the single fish upwards of two hundred barrels·

About this time the whale-ship Superior returned from a voyage through Behring’s StraitS, where she also
found the right whale of the North Pacific.

This fact induced the further inquiry, as to whether the right whale of Behring’s Straits, and the right
whale of Davis' Straits were the same animal. For since the fact had been established that the right whale
of the North Pacific could not cross the equator, and therefore could not get into the North Atlantic by either
of the CapeS, a reply in the affirmative to this induiry would be another link in the chain of circumstantia}
evidence, going to prove the existence of a so·called Northwest Passage.

The answer from the whalemen in this instance, waS, in effect ; “ we have not had an opportunity of com·
paring the two animaIS, except after long intervaIS, but, so far as we can judge, they are the same fish.’' So
far as other facts go, it would appear probable that there is, at times, at least an open water-communication
between the two straits; for the instincts of the.whale‚ one might suppose, would prevent him from sounding
under icebergs, neither could he pass under barriers of great depth or breadth. Seeing that water runs through
Bebring’s Straits from the Pacific, as well as around the CapeS, into the Atlantic‚ where, therefore, is the
escape-current from the Atlantic?

The Trade Wiuds, I am prepared to show, are the great evaporatiug wiuds, They are the windS, which,
returning from the polar regionS, deprived of all the moisture which the hyperboreau dew-point can compress
from them, first come in contact with the surface of the earth, (and consequently with an evaporatiug surface‚)
where they are first felt as tradeS, and where, therefore, they are dry windS.

Now could the vapor taken up by these winds so increase the saltness of this sea in the trade wind region,
as to make the water there though warmer, yet specifically beavier than that below, and also than that within

the regions of the variable winds and of “constant precipitation ? '’ If so, might we not have the anomaly of
