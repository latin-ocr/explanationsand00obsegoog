GERERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. . 71

Take the parallel of 4Ο N., as an illustration: during these two months, the entire belt of calms orasses this
parallel, and then leaves it in the region of the S. E. trades, During these two monthS, it was pouring down
rain on that parallel. After the calm belt passes it, the rains cease, and the people in that latitude have no

more wet weather till the fall, when the belt of calms recrosses this parallel on its way to the South. By
examining the “ Trade Wind Chart,'’ it may be seen what the latitudes are that have two rainy seasonS, and
that Bogota is within the bi-rainy latitudeS.

The coast of Peru is within the region of perpetual S. E. trade winds. Though the Peruvian shores are
on the verge of the great South sea boiler 3 yet it never rains there. The reason is plain, and the charts make
it obviouS. ⁸

The S. Ε. trade winds in the Atlantic ocean first strike the water on the coast os Africa. Traveling to
the N. W„ they blow obliquely across the ocean until they reach the coast of Brazil. By this time, they are
heavily laden with vapor, which they continue to bear along across the continent, depositing it as they go, and
supplying with it the sources of the Rio de la Plata and the southern tributaries of the Amazon.

. Finally, they reach the snow-capped Andes, and here is wrung from them, the least particle of moisture

that that very low temperature can extract.

Reaching the summit of the range, they now tumble down as cool and dry winds on the slopes beyond.
Meeting with no evaporating surface, and with no temperature colder than that to which they were subjected
on the mountain tops, they reach the ocean before they become charged with fresh vapor, and before, therefore,
they have any which the Peruvian climate can extract. Thus we see how the top of the Andes becomes the
reservoir from which are supplied the rivers of Chile and Peru.

We see, moreover, that the Andes and all other mountains which run North and South have a dry and a
rainy side, and that the prevailing winds of the latitude determine which is the rainy and which the dry side.

Thus let us take the southern coast of Chile for illustration : in our summer time, when the sun comes
North, and drags aster him his belts of perpetual winds and calmS, that part of the coast is left within the regions
of the N. W. winds-the winds that are counter to the S. E. trades—which, cooled by the winter tempera-
ture of the highlands of Chile, deposite their moisture copiously. During the rest of the year, the most of
Chile is in the regions of the S. E. tradeS‚ and the same causes which operate in California to prevent rain
there, operate in Chile3 only the dry season in one place is the rainy season of the other.

Hence we see that the weather side of all such mountains as the Andes is the wet side, and the lee side
the dry.

We shall now be enabled to determine, if the views which Ι have been endeavoring to present be correct,
what parts of the earth are subject to the greatest fall of rain. They should be on the slopes of those mountains
which the trade winds first strike aster having blown across the greatest tract of ocean. The more abrupt the
elevation as the land rises from the ocean, the greater the amount of precipitation.

If, therefore, we commence at the parallel of about 300 N. in the Pacific‚ where the N. E. trade winds
first strike that ocean, and trace them through their circuits till they first strike l'a'igh mountainS, we ought to

find such a place of heavy rains.
