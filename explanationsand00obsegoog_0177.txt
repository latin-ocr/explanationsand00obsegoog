3 A. M.‚ water at surface 780.

4 A. M.‚ water at suriace 740, at 50 fathoms 700, at 100 fathorns 640.

5 Α. Μ., water at sursace 720.

6 A. M.‚ water at surface 710.

Heading during these three hours N. W. by N., at the rate of three and a half knots an honr. At9 A. M.

,the water stood at sursace 69.50‚ at 50 fathoms 65.50, at 100 fathoms 65.50. By 1 P. M.‚ the temperature at
sursace had fallen to 63.50, at 50 sathoms to 5850, at 100 fathoms 580, the temperature of the air being 680.

When on soundings next day, June lst, in latitude 390 N ., longitude 700 30 W„ the water showed as
low as 510 at surfnce, and maintained an average temperature of 530 until we reached New York. This is a

differ-enee of 280 smm the adjacent GulfStream. Shoals of porpoises and black fish were seen by us in the
h'ot waters of the stream. We saw very little Gulf or sea weed (fucus natans) in it, but much at its ¹outer
edge. While mentioning this weed 1 may here remark, that we looked in vain, in the region assigned to the
Sargasso sea, for the 'great fields οἱ it which have been reported. Small patches of five or six feet, generally
arranged in long parallel lines in the direction of the wind, were seen daily in crossiug the Atlantic till we
reached the longitude of 280 when it disappeared altogether. My frequent examinationis of this weed satisfy
me that, wherever it may originally come from, it feeds and grows upon the waters of the sea, which is cer·
tainly not more strange than the plant which feeds upon the air.

We discovered the hot water-r (ff the Guls Stream extending as far east as 720 10’ in a latitude so far
south as 330 30'. The column of water temperatures in the “ Abstract” from May 23d to 29th, while en-

gaged in the search sor Ashton rock, will satissy you of this interesting and important fact3 sor you willnotice
that whenever we reached that longitude, in our various traclrs between the latitudes 330 30' and 340 North,
we experienced a sudden change of as much as 50 and 60 in the surface temperatum—700 to 760. This must
be a branch or offset from the Gulf stream, being so far to the eustward of the limits hitherto given' to it im
those latitantes. We first noticed this extraordinary change of temperature on the 3‘23d--the temperature of

sur-face water rising on that day ‘from 71.50 to 790. 1 cite from the Abstract:

Midnight, commencing 23d May, latitude 320 35’ North, longitude 730 24’ ; surface water 71.50, at 50
fathoms 71.50‚ 100 sathoms 670.

8 A. M.‚ latitude 320 58¹ North, longitude 730 36’, sarsace water 730. .

9 Α. Μ., latitude 320 50 North, longitude 730 38', sursace water 750, at 50 fathoms 73.50‚ 100 fathoms
700.

3 Ρ. Μ., latitude 330 03³ North, longitude 730 52¹, surface water 790.

The current at 6 A. M. was found by trial to be one knot per hour, setting W. N. W„ and the under
current (at 126 sathoms) one knot, setting to the E. ; the current felt by the vessel (as determined by compa·
rison of results of observation and dead-reckoning) was 1.50 knot per bour, setting westerly ; this was
between 8 A. M. and 4 Ρ. Μ. The variations os temperature os the water, recorded on the next day, (24th
of May,) in latitude 330 25’, longitude 720 40¹, are worthy of notice—-the sudden fall of 3} degi-ees in one
