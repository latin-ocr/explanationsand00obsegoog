“December 12111. The experiments in sounding to· -day have been signally unfortunate, and I much sear
that no satisfactory result will ever be obtained with the line we 11313. In fact, it is only throwing away the
shot, and is moreovera complete loss of time. We lay to two hours to·day, and achieved nothing.

“ The lst shot parted aster running 7 minuteS, at a depth of 600 fathoms; the fracture took place near
the surface, and I send you the end that we hauled up. You will see how it untwisted, although it did not
break there. The twisted end, with a single knot upon it, is where it broke, 1 think there was a knot there
which slipped.

“ The 211 31101 parted at about 20 sathoms below the sur-face 3 no jerk, and the 1331 running freely. 1 send
you the end that we hauled up, it has two knots near it. You will see that both this and the former are clean,
sharp, cut ends. Ithink that this also was knotted and slipped.

“The 3d 31101 parted the line between the ree] and my hand, when it had 1133031111311 30οῙ311101113,3ηά had

line. It is though evidently a weak spot.

“ The 4111 31101 parted the line at a great depth, when it had run out 550 sathomS, and had been running
5 minutes.

“ The 6th shot parted in the same way, after 200 fathoms had run out.

“ In these five experiments the line was oiled.

“ The 6th shot parted the line after 200 sathoms had run out3 the oiling was dispensed with in this case.

“ The seventh 3ηά 1331 301111111118 1133 1113113 111111 311 1111011311 11113, 111111 three bars of iron lashed together,
about 18 inches long, and weighing about 121113. Τ113 11113 parted after running out 1,000 fathoms between
the 1331 and my hand, when the weight was descending very slowly indeed 3 there was scarcely strain enough
to turn the reel; it is evidently a slip, as you may see from the end, which 1 send you3 it has seven knots

near it. It had been running 22 minutes.

“ 1 also send you two specimenS, cut from our twine, to show you what sort of stuff 1133 113311 33111 10 113.
As 3 11131131 os strict fact, we are somewhat to blame sor the slipping os the 1111013, although we had 110 reason to
suspect that they would slip before yesterday. Still, the malrers should be rowed·up for being 30 faithless.
By the way, we dud not get the line until a day or two before we sailed, and had 110 chance to examine it
caresully, and were 31311 obliged to mark it in the greatest hurry. Capt. Platt was informed that it would be
33111 to him marked at every thousand sathomS, but it did not 11313 3 mark upon it. Send us good line, and
we will give you as many soundings as you wish. The captain is much interested in the experiments, as you
may see from the expenditure of shots 3 we have lost 25 in these few experimentS, enough to show that the
line is not trustworthy. A light werght gives very uncertain sounding, by reason os the great length of time

it takes to run out, and the great drist in consequence.
