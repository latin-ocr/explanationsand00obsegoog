“The dreadful apprehensions that assailed us yesterday by the near approach of the iceberg, were this
day most awfully verified. About 3 P. M. the iceberg came in contact with our floe, and in less than one
minute it broke the ice3 we were frozen in quite close to, the shore; the floe was shivered to picces for several
miles, causing an explosion like an earthquake or one hundred pieces os heavy ordnance fired at the same
moment. The iceberg‚ with awsul but majestic grandeur, (in height and dimensions resembling a vast moun·

tain,) came almost up to our stem, and every one expected it would have run over the ship. ⁴* ⁴ ⁴*

“ The iceberg, as has been before observed‚ came up very near to the stern of our ship ; the inter-mediate
space between the berg and the vessel was filled with masses of heavy icc, which though they had been pre-
viously broken by the immense weight of the berg, were again formed into a compact body by its pressure.
The berg was drifting at the rate of about four know, and by its force on the mass of ice‚ was pushing the ship
before her, as it appeared, to inevitable destruction.''

“ Feb. Qut—The iceberg still in sight, but driving away fast to the N. 133²

“ Feb. 25th.—The iceberg that so lately threatened our destruction, had driven completely out os sight
to the N. E. srom uS.”—Arctic Reginus—voyage to Davis' Struit, by Doroa Duncan, Master os the Skip Dandee,
1826-7.

Now then whence, unless from the difference of specific gravity due sea water of different degrees of salt-

ness, can we derive a locomotive power with force sufficient to give such tremendous masses of ice such a
velocity ?

What is the temperature os this under current? Be that what it may, it is probably above the fieezing point of
sea water. Suppose it to be at 360. Break through the ice in the northern seas, and the temperature of the water
is always 280. At least Lieut. De Haven so found it in his long imprisonment, and it may be supposed that
as it was with him, so it generally is. Assuming then the water of the surface current which runs out with the
ice to be all at 280, we observe that it is not unreasonable to suppose that the water of the under current, in·
asmuch as it comes from the South, and therefore from warmer latitudeS, is probably not so cold, and if it be
not so cold, its temperature before it comes out again must be reduced to 280, or whatever be the average
temperature of the outer but surface current.

Moreover‚ if it be true as some philosophers have suggested, *that there is in the depths of the ocean a line
stom the equator to the poles, along which the water is of the same temperature all the way, then the question

may be asked: should we not have in the depths of the ocean, a sort of isothermal floor, as it were, on the
upper side of which all the changes of temperature are due to agents acting from above, and on the lower side

os which 'the changes, if any, are due to agents acting from below?

This under Polar current water then, as it rises to the top, and is brought to the surface by the agitation
os the sea in the Arctic regions, gives out its sur-plus heat and warms the atmosphere there till the temperature
of this warm 'under current water is lowered to the requisite degree sor going out on the surface. Hence the
water-sky of those regions·

And the heat that it loses in falling froin its normal temperature, be that what it may, till it reaches the

temperature of 280, is so much caloric set free in the Polar regions to temper the air and mitigate the climate
