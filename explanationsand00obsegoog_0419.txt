You can see by reference. to the book published by Commodore Wilkes, that the extreme cold had but in
one instance been as low as 50 below zero. This 1 ascertained from a sels-regulating thermometer, in latitude
630, and gave him. Since that time, it has never been so low. The heat 1 could not ascertain, as the index
. in the tube shisted, while Ι was lifting the instrument up. 1 tried to procure one sometime ago in New York,
but could not find one. I intended to bave placed it in a much higher latitude, as very little is known about

either extreme of temperatura on the land. For instance, many suppose that Palmer‘s Land is a continent,

and connects with the land laid down by Wilkes3 however, this is not the case, for 1 have sailed round

' Palmer’s Land and sar South of it.

Owing partly to negligence and partly to disasterS, Ι have no logs or books which will be of use to you.
But 1 will try this cruise to send you some ; and if you know of anything particular from the La Plata to as sar

as ’70Ο S.‚ Ι may be able to give you some information, sor to that place I have given most of my attention, as

my business has been there during the greater part ot‘ the time.

While 1 was at this book it occurred to me to send some leaves out of a scratch book which might be of

some use in showing tides, harborS‚ &c., so 1 tore them out and send them to you. I have done this very

hastily and in a most bungling manner, but Ι did not know that 1 would have to go away so soon and would

not be able to finish. So I have driven abead and done what I could.

1f you choose I will distribute those charts to men who 1 know will take care to return the journal to you,

on their return home, for Ι consider them to be a benefit to all seafaring men.

1 will write you again before 1 leave.'’

 

The opinions expressed by these two navigators—Captains Bryson and Smyley—as to the passage to the

Line, and the Cape Horn Route,·are fully confirmed by the Pilot Charts3 and though sometimes a vessel by
going to the East of the Falkland Islands, may have good luck, fine weather, good windS, and a short passage,
it should be considered as the exception, but by no means as the rule. ’ The combined experience of all the
Cape Horn navigators whose journals have been consulted during the progress of my investigationS, is against

the eastern, and in favor of the western, or in-shore passage, as a general rule.

Ι find in the Abstract log os the Ship “ Defiance„ (Robt. McCerran) the following excellent remark3‚
concerning this passage:

“ September 261h‚ 1852. At 430 A. M. hove to for daylight. At 8.30 A. Μ. entered the straits of “ Le
Maire ;” wind at N. N. Ε. At 10 A. M. Cape St. Diego bore West per compass, and Staten Laud S. E„
entirely covered with snow. At 11.30 clear of the strait. I am surprised that this strait is not passed by all
ships in preference to passing East of Staten Land3 “ Le Maire'' being free from shoaIS, and 14 miles wide.

An experience of 21 years command in the Liverpool trade convinces me that the passage between Tuskar 3ηά
the Smalls are trebly dangerouS, and I can see no difficulty in this passage that is not much greater in the

navigation of the Irish Channel, either North or South about.
1 should certainly beat through in preference to going within 3 miles os the land. Ι have no doubt that
