’ Ι am not prepared to maintain that the water-level of our great system of lakes has been changed by any suc
process 3 though 1 do not think it improbable. Nor am 1 prepared to ascribe the change in the Salt lake of Uta
wholly to obstructionS, near or remote, which have prevented the winds from bringing as many and as copiot
rain-clouds as they at some remote period were want to bring to this valley3 though in this case it appear
obvious that the precipitation has diminished, and the evaporation has increased ; and it is not easily perceive
how a mere subsidence of the Lake basin would change the 'rate of evaporation, or alter the amount of pr(
eip'itation there. “ “

· “ Having, therefore, I hope, made clear the meaning of the question proposed, by showing the manner i
which win'ds may become important geological agents ; and having explained how the upheaving of a mountai
range in one part os the world may, through the wind8‚ affect climates and produced geological phe-nomena i
another, 1 retu'rn to the Dead sea, and the great inland basius of Asia, and ask how far is it possible for th
elevation of the South' American continent, and the uphea'va] of its mountainS, to have had any effect upon th
water-level of those seas ?' · There are indications that they all once had a higher water-level than they not
have3 'and that formerly ‚ffle ,amount of precipitation was greater‘than it now is t then what has become of th
sources ‘of'vaporF What-'ghas‘ dimitiished its supply ?' Its supply would be diminished hy the substitutio]
'of ¹ dry land, in iho'se parts of ⁴the⁴t>cean which used to supply that vapor} or the quantity of vapor deposite«
in thehydro'graphicai basias of those sem, would 'have been lessened if a snow-capped range os mountains ha«
been elevate-d across the path of 'these winds and between ' the places where they were supplied with vapor
and these basins. '

' 'A chain of evidence, which it· would be difficult to set aside, c‘an be introduced, ir required, to show tha
the vapor which supplies the extra-tropica} regions of the North with rainS, cornea, in all probability, from th«
trade-wind regions of the southern hemisphere. ι

The prevailing winds of the Temperate Zones blow towards the poles: they are going from warmer t<
colder clit'nateS. Consequently their capacity> sor moisture' increases with their temperature ; and the)
must precipitate,·on their way {rom warmer to colder regions, more water than they can take up again.

’ The prevailing winds of th'e Torrid Zone blow towards the equator: they are going from colder to warme1
climatesa Their capacity formoisture is therefore on the increase3 and they therefore 'must evaporate‚ from
this zone, more water than they precipitata upon it again.

All the great rivers lie in the northern hemisphere. With more land and less water, its total amount o.
precipitation is nevertheless greater, than that of. the southern hemisphere.

The evaporating surface ossea water, exposed to the action of the southeast trade winds exceedS, severas
times in extent, that upon which the northeast trade winds are known to play. These southeast trade windsf
when they arrive at the belt of equatorial calmS, charged with vapor from the sea, should, when they rise uf
and corne over into this hemisphere, take, in consequence of the Earth’s diurna] motion, a direction to th(
northeast. This is the direction which the rains of the Mississippi valley indicate, and which the microscope

-of Ehrenberg has 'proved that the southeast trade winds do take3 for in a northeasterly direction from the great
