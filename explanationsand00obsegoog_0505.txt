the ‘⁸ Flying Fish'’ before alluded tn. But for that one mistake, her passage to Calisornia would probably have
been the shortest on record.

This mistake is common among navigator& But one in crossing the equator as far as 350 W. is not hope-
lessly too far west; and even then he had better go straight across the “ Doldrutns,'' trusting toluck sor slants,
than attempt to make easting in those calm places· Twelve days after the “ Flying Fish” had crossed the
equator, in the Atlantic, which she did in 340 30', the ‘⁴ Trade Wind’' came along and crossed it in 34ο 10’
with the wind S.S.E. of course, she could have made an east course on the starboard track, but she took fire,
burned sor eight hourS, and was in imminent danger of being destroyed. During this time she lost a degree
of longitude by falling that much to the westward. Notwithstanding all this, she was only six days from the
Line to 90 S.‚ which cleared her os everything. But sor the fire, her passage to California would probably
have been less than one hundred dayS.

There is another circumstance which l have observed, and which is worthy of notice in this connexion,
as illustrative of the accuracy of the knowledge which the investigations upon which these charts are
based, afford concerning the force, set and direction both of winds and currents, and it is this ι

In calculating the best routes for the different monthS, pp. 347, et seq. Ι have calculated also the distance
which a vessel undertaking to follow these routeS, would have to accomplish, on account of detour caused by
head windS, διο. · On this occasion, only the “ John Gilpin’' and the “ Hazard'' entered the distance by log from
New York to the Line. The distance which, according to the sailing directions, each vessel would, at that
season of the year, after allowing for the deviations which head winds would require herto make srom the
straight course, have to sail to reach the equator, is 43115 mileS. The “ Gilpin’' actually logged 4,099, the
“ Hazard„ 4,077. Thus accomplishing inssthe year 1852, the voyage by sailing, the one within 38, the other
within 16 mileS, of the distance which by calculation in 1849, it was predicted they would have to accomplish.

All the maritime nations of the world have been invited by the United States Government to co-operate
with us in making observations at sea, according to an uniform plan, and in keeping abstract logs for the Wind
and Current Charts; and with the view of enlisting the services of private shipmasters, under foreign flags, in
his undertaking, 1 am authorized by Mr. Dobbin, the Secretary of the Navy, to place the merchant service of all
friendly nations upon the same footing with regard to the Wind and Current Charts, which American shipmasters
occupy. That is, any merchant captain, whatever be the flag he sails under, who will agree to keep and furnish
an abstract log of every voyage according to the sorm prescribed at pp. 486-487‚ and on the terms set forth at p.
485 of this work, will be surnished therefor, with a copy of these Sailing Directions and of such sheets of the
charts as relate to his cruising ground. ⁶

Therefore, before applying for the charts, each master should furnish himself with at least one good
chronometer‚ one good sextant, two good steering compasses, a marine barometer and three air and water
.tbermometers. I say at least, because this is the smallest outfit of instruments that can enable the navigator

properly to perform his part of the agreement.
