METEORoLochL OBSERVATIONS AT SEA. 33

governmentS. Every year is now producing publications of this nature in the countries referred to, and by the
rapid intercommunication of these, the results of the experience of one country and the modifications and
improvements which experience may suggest, become quickly known to all. To call on countries already so
advanced in systematically conducted meteorological observations to remodel their instructions and instrumentS,
with a view of establishing uniformity in these respectS, would probably, if pressed, elicit from other govern-
ments also the reply which her Majesty’s Government have received from Prince Schwarzenberg, conveyed in
the Earl of Westmoreland's letter to Viscount Palmerston, viz : the transmission of a copy of the instructions
which have been given to the Meteorological ObservatorieS, sorty·five in number, in the Austrian dominions,
and a reference to the results obtained at those observatories, which are stated to be in regular course of
publication.

· “ In an earlier stage, when these establishments were either forming or were only in contemplation, it was
considered that advantage might arise from a discussion of the objects to be principally kept in view, and of
the instruments and methods by which these might be most successfully prosecuted. For this purpose, a con-
ference was held at Cambridge, in England, in 1845, which was attended by many of the most distinguished
Meteorologists in Europe, and amongst them by all the gentlemen whose names are above stated, and who
were expressly sent by their respective governmentS. The impulse communicated by this assemblage was
without doubt highly beneficial, and the influence of the discussions which took place may perhaps be traced
in some of the arrangements under which the researches in different countries are now proceeding; but in the

stage to which they have advanced, it may be doubted whether any measures are likely to be more beneficial

than those which would increase the facilities of a cheap and rapid intercommunication os the results of the
researches which are in progreSS.

“ With reference ‘ to the suggestions made by the scientific men of the United States,' “ the proposition
of Lieutenant Maury, to give a greater extension and a more systematic direction to the meteorological obser-
vations to be made at sea, appears to be deserving of the most serious attention of the Board of Admiralty.
In order to understand the importance of this proposition, it will be proper to refer to the system of observa·
. tions which has been adopted of late years in the navy and merchant service of the United StateS, and to some

> few of the results to which it has already led. Instructions are given to naval captains and masters of ships,
to note in their logs the points of the compass from which the wind blows, at least once in every eight hours:
to record the temperature of the air, and of the water at the surface, and when practicable, at considerable
depths of the sea: to notice all remarkable phenomena which may serve to characterize particular regions of
the ocean, more especially the direction, the velocity, the depths and the limits of the currents: special instruc-
tions also are given to whalerS, to note down the regions where whales are found, and the limits of the range
os their different species. A scheme for taking these observations regularly and systematically, was submitted
by Lieut. Maury to the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, in 1842, and instantly adopted:
detailed instructions were given to every American shipmasten upon his clearing from the Custom House, ac-

companied by a request that they would transmit to the ptoper office, after their return from their voyage,
