or between the monsoonsand each of these two systems of winds, that contribute so much to the prolonga-

tion of the passage from Panama.

Of course, where two winds meet from different quarterS, every navigator knows he must have a belt of
calms or light baffiing airs; sor a wind from the N. Ε. and a wind from the S. E. cannot blow each at the

same time and place. Therefore, when two such winds meet, their line of meeting is marked by calms

and baffiing aira.

Now my investigations have been carried sar enough to show that at certain seascns of the year, a vessel

bound srom Panama to California, must cross at least three, at some seasons four, such meetings of windS, or
hands of calmS, before she can enter the region of N. E. tradeS. Hence the tedious'passage.

But, although the researches connected with these charts have revealed this fact, the materials upon which
they are founded are not sufficient to show with certainty the best way of avoiding these calm and baffiing re·-
gionS.

In the absence of more special information, and in view of the important interests to'be subserved by a
shortening of the passage from Panama to Calisornia and Oregon, 1 venture the following suggestions as to that
passage. These suggestions derived from the light which the experience of those Panama traders whose loga
1 have, cast upon the subject. But this light is feeble, because the materials whence it is derived are meagre.
Still they amount to several thousand observations carefully made3 and in the aggregate they are worth more
than the experience of any single navigator in that trade can possibly be. NevertheleSS, I do not ask for them
that degree of confidence to which the “ sailing directions '' given in this work are generally entitled. These
suggestionS, added to individua! experience, will probably be found by navigators to be of some service.

In the discussion of the winds as it is conducted for the Pilot ChartS, Panama and its approaches are included
between the parallels of50 and 100 N. Between these parallels and East os 85Ο West, it appears from the obser-
vations which have been discussed, that the prevailing winds in November, December, J anuary, May, June and
J uly, are between N. W. and S. W. inclusive3 that in December, January, February and March they prevail
about one-fifth of the time from the northward and eastward ; that calms are least prevalent in the month of
March, the prevailing wind sor March being N. W.; and for June S. W. ; though N. W. winds are also fre·
quent in J une3 and that for the other months, the observations are too sew to give any indication as to the
prevailing windS.

Between the same two parallels but to the west of 85Ο and as far as 950, the prevailing winds are, in De-
cember, January, and February, N. E. ; in March and April they are variable‚ prevailing alternately srom N. E.
and N. W. In May, June, July, August, and September, they prevail from South to S. W. inclusive3 in
October srom S. E. to S. W. inclusive. ln November they are inclined to variable, though from S. E. by
the way of South to W. S W. is the favorite quarter. .

It is moreover indicated that to the east of 800 the winds in December, January‚ and February, prevail-
ing as they do from the northward and westwarrd‚ are generally favorable for getting to the southward and

westward,8b8y steering S. S. W. or S. W.; that in May, calma are frequent, and the prevailing points of the
