Now let us see, supposing it was a current that took out the line after it had parted and tailed out straight
with the ‘nh length of 500 sathoms out, at what rate it ought to have gone out to a drift which dragged the
boat “at the rate os nearly, sometimes sully, a knot and a half an hour.''

From the 8th to the 16th time, inclusive, 4500 fathoms line, or about 5 miles (5.11) of the line was
taken out os the boat in 4h. 32m. 30s.‚ or at the average rate of nearly one mile and one eighth (1.13) an
hour, or 500 fathoms in 30m. 16s.

The boat, says Lieut. Parker, was dragged whenever he held on to the line “at the rate of nearly, some·
times fully, a knot and a half an hour.’'

Suppose it to have averaged lk knots per hour, the average rate at which the line would have then been
taken, would have been 500 fathoms in 27m. 16s., instead ofin 30m. 16s. Thus, Lieut. Parker estimates his
current to be at a rate which would take off 500 fathoms from the reel in 27m. 16s. 3 when it actually required
30m. 16s. to take off 500 fathoms.

We may therefore, 1 think, sasely conclude, that if he had have continued his experiments till this time, he
would have found his line going out at about the rate os 500 sathoms in 30m.

“ Ῑ should be glad to have the specimen· which Lieut. Parker brought up from the depth of 280
fathomS, at his sounding of May 13th. Itis described as clay, and no doubt would be considered by Bartlett

of West Point, Ehrenberg of Berlin, and other microscopists, as a great treasure. Specimens from the bottom

at great depths would be very valuable. Specimens of the ooze (a piece as large as a pea will be ample)
which may be brought up on the anchor, or the deep-sea lead, in the harbors and along the coast, would be
very acceptable, and 1 will esteem it as a favor if you will have them procured-properly and carefully labelled
—and sent me.

Lieut. Parker would have given additional value to his soundings is he had timed on every occasion every
100 fathorn mark, as it went out. Both you and he will readily perceive the importance of timing the 100
fathom mark83 for the work of one officer not only thus checks itsels, but it serves as a check also upon that of

other officers in different parts of the world.’'
