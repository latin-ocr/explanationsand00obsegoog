recommended. These lines are intended to show the route that vessels should take, not the traclc that they
should make. Vessels taking such routes, should be guided ΒΥ these lines as to the general direction which
they ought to pursue. It was never intended that, with fair windS, they should make the aig-zags of
these lines. But some navigators have inserted that there was virtue in these lines themselves 3 that they must be
followed as rigidly and as closely as though they marked out a channel·way, on either side of which if a vessel
should fall, she would find herself in difficulty. Accordingly, abstracts that have been returned to me show
frequent instances wherein vesseIS, after having been headed off from the projected track, have had the winds
persectly fair for pursuing their straight course onward, yet they have nevertheless proceeded to make a head
wind of such, and to beat back out there on the open sea, for the purpose of getting back on the track pro-
jected.

Suppose that ship A, makes an uncommonly quick run to a given port, and that she gives her track ιο Β;
Β attempts it, but is headed off. Now B from this new position will not attempt to go out of his way to get
actually in the wake made ΒΥ Α; but B will shape his course by that of A and run ΒΥ it ; and consider that he
is following it, when he is near it. This is what I wish vessels to do with regard to the routes that 1 have
projected for them. Do not go out of your way ιο get ou those trackS, but consider yourself, unless especially
directed otherwise, to be in good position when you are within one or two hundred miles of the projected track
according to the quantity of sea-room.

Therefore, when you are near the projected track, consider yourself in as good a position as though you
were actually on it. Ι

For the purpose of affording navigatore and ship owners an opportunity of comparing the new and the
,old routes together, and of drawing their own conclusions as to the advantages of the routes recommended by

me, Professor Flye has taken at random, and just as they came ιο hand, a number of tracks by each route,

and has stated those for the several months in the tables below.

It should be borne in mind that this showing, though greatly in favor of the new tontes, is not as much
so as it will probably be after navigators shall come to understand them better, and ιο have more confidence in
them.

Several vessels are put down under the new route, which purs'ued it to the equatorial calmS, became
searsul of falling to leeward, abandoned it and ran over to the eastward to fall in with the old beaten track3 and
had long passages. The cases of such will be mentioned under the head of remarks for the several months·
Though there is reason to believe that their passages were considerably prolonged in consequence of thus

abandoning the new route, yet they are counted as among the vessels that have tried it, because of my desire

not to overstate the advantages of the new route. I prefer to err, if it all, on the safe side.
