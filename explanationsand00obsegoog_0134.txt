311331311011 3311 313 therefore quite different as to their components from any arm, frith or gulf of the
ocean?

How therefore shall we account for this sameness of compound, but upon the supposition of a g
system of circulation'in the ocean, by which in the process of time, water from one part, is conveyed to a
part the most remote, and by which 3 general interchange and commingling os the waters take place?

In like manner, the constituente of the atmosphere whether it be analysed at the equator or the
are the same. By cutting off and shutting up from the general channels os circulation any portion
water, as in the Dead sea, or of atmospheric air, as in mines or weIIS, we can easily fill either with gas
other matter that shall very much effect its character and alter the proportions of its constituentS.

The principal agents that 313 supposed to be concerned in giving circulation to the atmosphere, ε
preserving the ratio among its components, are light, beat, electricity 3311 perhaps magnetism ; but as
the motive power is 3033313311, or that agency by which the atmosphere that may now be within the tro
wasted to the polee, heat and electricity are supposed to be the chief among them.

But with regard to the sea, it is not known what office is performed by electricity and magnetism in
dynamical force to the system of oceanic circulation. The chief motive power from which marine ct
derive their velocity, has been ascribed to heat: but a close study of the agents concerned has suggested
important—hay, a powersul and active agency in the system os oceanic circulation is derived, throu
instrumentality of the windS, of marine plants and animale, from the salts of the sea water. They g}
ocean great dynamical force.

Let us, for the sake of illustration 3ηά explanation, suppose the sea in all its parts—in its depths, anc‘
sursace, at the equator and about the poles—to be of one uniform temperature, 3ηά 10 113 all os fresh wate
this case, there would be nothing of beat to disturb its equilibrium, and there would be no motive power t«
currente, or to set the water in motion by reason of the difference of specific gravity due to water at di
densities and temperatureS.

As yet we have not taken into account in this supposition, the effects of the winds 3311 of evapora
begetting currents.

Let us therefore take them into account: but first the winds, The winds by their force create parti
face currents and agitate the waters to acertain depth, 3ηά thus would give rise to 3 feeble 3ηά partial a·

circulation in the supposed 3333 of fresh water with 3 supposed uniform temperature.
