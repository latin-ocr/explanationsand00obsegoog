not enable us to decide satisfactorily as to the existence of such a belt of uniform, or nearly uniform, ocean
temperatures for any one year.

Taking the isotherms of 500 and 60Ο to illustrate the manner generally, in which the waters of different
temperatures run into each other, we shall find that their line of separation is not smooth, but jagged. Τ he
line of junction between the warm and cold waters of the sea, is not unlike the sutures of the skull bone on
a grand scale. The waters of one temperature are dovetailed and fitted into those of another, in apparently
the most irregular manner ; but nevertheleSS, like the sutures of the skull when they corneto be examined closely,
these lines of articulation clearly indicate traces of symmetry. They have their lawS.

Now a vessel,—when waters of marked differences of temperature meet,—that sails along near their line
of junction, will come across layers or streaks os water, at one time warmer, at another cooler. Where a
jagged point of warmer water is found in one month to thrust itself up into a body of cooler water, perhaps
the next month it will be found that this obtruding os the warm water, has disappeared, and given place to the
intrusion from the cooler water—of an articulating surface equally irregular in its outlineS. Such layers
of cooler and warmer streaks of water are generally to be found along that part of the usual sailing route
‘between New Yossr and the north os Europe, which runs with the Gulf Stream.

A better idea as to these irregularities in the temperatura of the ocean, cannot be conveyed than by
quoting from the logs os a few of'the many vessels in that trade, which are co·operating with me in collecting
materials for the “ Wind and Current ChartS,’' and from which it will be seen that it is by no means an extra-

ordinary occurrence for the water thermometer, in the course of one good day’s sail, to pass through a range

—up and down—of 500.
