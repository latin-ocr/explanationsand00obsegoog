(see A—Plate VI 3) and the lower number shows the per cent. of “ the times'’ in which calrnS, according to the
number of observations made, and the principles of average& ought to prevail sor as much as 8 hours at a
time. Thus, in said square A there have been discussed sor the pilot chartS, in the month of J uly, 433 obser·

vationS‚ and os these, 8, or 2 per cent. represented calms as the prevailing condition of the atmosphere sor that

month and part os the ocean.

These two quantities are thus stated in order to enable me as well as those who take the charts for their
guide, to form some estimate as to the degree cf confidence due, or as to the weight to be attached to, the
courses recommended and the routes proposed.

Thus more weight is attached to a course that should be recommended through square A, than to one
through square B; because, in A, average results are derived from 433 observations; whereas in B, they
depend upon only 21 3 and calmS, it appearS‚ prevail·there 11.1 per cent. os the time, which is probably out
os proportion.

The object, however, is to show the proportion according to the ratio of per centage, of the winds from
each point of the compass, and the per centage by which, according to that showing, a vessel in attempting
to sail 100 mileS‚ or any other distance through that square on any given course, would in the average have to
increase that distance on account of the average prevalence of adverse winds. .

Thus suppose a vessel should wish to sail West through square B in J uly t—an inspection of the plate will
show, supposing the 21 observations give a fair average as to the winds in that square sor that mouth, that
16.5 per cent. of the winds there, are from the West3 that 11 per cent. are from W. S. W.; 3.5 from W. N.
W.; 16.5 from S. W.; and 5.5 from N. W.; all these winds are adverse for a VVest course, and conse·
quently, they would compel her to turn off from a West course so as to increase the distance required, 324
per cent.

In truth, it appears from those 21 observations, that 49.5 per cent. os all the winda that blow here in
J uly, are between W. and S. S. W„ inclusive3 that it is calm 11.1 per cent. of the time3 and that conse-
quently, it is an unfavorable part of the ocean for a vessel to pass through, that wants to get from Europe to
the United States, i. e., that wants to get to the southward and westward 3 it moreover appears that a vessel
would have no difficulty except on account of the calins, in getting to the eastward through this same
region.

Again, the square C, which is between two lower parallels, and in which we have the experience of 4Ι
,vessels to guide us: a vessel to make a W. S. W.. course through this square, in July, would have to contend
‚against ‚535 per cent. of winds directly abead, with the chauces cs “having to increase her distance 9337 per
cent. flere ,we again see the prevalence os ¹head winds for -vessels bound tc the United States, and perceive

that it is a bad part τοἱ the ocean for a vessel so bound to be in, though there are nc calms.
lt is thus that the ,chart for J uly, sor the whole ocean, is filled up from the Pilot Chart, with the per cent.

of calms and head winda for each month. This is an operation which involves an immense amount of labor.
