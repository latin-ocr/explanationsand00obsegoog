1t is not the easiest thing in the world to distinguish the different kinds of whales, even to those who have
been in the whaling business, and a ship must be brought close by a whale to tell for certain his kind.

The sperm whale is found in all climateS, and in every sea; he seeds upon an inanimate animal substance
called a squid, which grows upon the buttom of the sea, and is never seen upon the surface, except when torn
up by the whale. Ihave seen it in large pieces fioating upon the surface. 1 have seen a dying whale vomit
it up. 1 have opened the stomach of a whale and seen it there in pieces: which convinces me that the animal
is very large, also as well as small; and that the sperm whale almost alwayS, when in want of food, goes to

i the ocean's bed.

Ι (10 not know as 1 shall be able to procure sor yon a whale’s horn, as they are difficult to take; but if no
ill betide me, Ι will bring you the under and upper jaw of a Russian whale, which will be about 24 feet long
by 16 diameter, which will serve to show the magnitude of this animal, and perhaps we may obtain the h‘orn
and something more.

Ι obtained the last season 3,200 barrels of oil, and 40,000 whale·bone, which 1 shipped from here to Eng-
land‚ and try my fortune another season. 1 commenced whaling in 1833, at 17 years-of age, and it has been
the whole study of my life ever since that time; and I am writing a book with all the knowledge Ι posseSS,

giving a particular description of all kinds of whales, with all my opinionS, δια, which Ι will forward unto you

upon my return to the States. Ῑ shall sail from here the loth of February, and expect to be in 600 North on
the soth of March. It would require too much paper to send, by mail, full answers to your enquiries, and 1
¹s· can only say, that Ι heartily rejoice that we have one man in our Government who will condescend to take no-

tice os a business whose annual income is millionS‚ and at the present time has broken down all competition

of other nations, and is supplying the markets of the world with oil. 1 shall also be able to give you some of
my opinions of ocean currentS, διο. Ι have a set of your Wind and Current Charts, which I am happy to say,

1 consider very useful, and have found them so. When 1 arrive at home, you will hear from me soon.''

 

Capt. McKenzie to Lieut. Maury—New Beogford, May 22, 1851.

⁶⁴ Your communication of zoth inst. is just received, contents duly noticed; in reply say:

11 is both the right and sperm whale that is covered with hair? but not on the outer surface. The hair is

found between the two skins 3 the outside skin is thinner than the finest paper, separated from the second or
inner skin by a muddy substance covering the whole animal a quarter of an inch thick.

In this muddy substance lays imbedded a thick coat of hair, (as whalemen call it,) nearly half an inch

long, resembling the finefur found on a seal after picking off the hair.

This is known to all who, sor once, have witnessed the cutting and boiling of either of the above species

of whale.

 

⁸ captain M has since furnished me with specimen* of this Ι hair) To the naked eye, it looks very like hair, but Professor Bayly,
petuo-hu examinet! it with the microacope, think· it i· not hair.
