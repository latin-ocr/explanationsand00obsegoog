Let us see what light the information contained in these two tables will throw upon the best California
route.

It is worthy of remark that the crossing between 1150 and 1200 W.‚ gives the shortest average for each
of the months of January, February, March, April, May and June, and that the shortest passage sor each of the
months of February, April, May, October, and December, was also made by crossing the linc between the same
‘meridianis of 1150 and 1200.

The next best crossing on the average appears to be between 1100 and 1150, though crossings enough sor
compar-ison to the West of 1200 are wanting.

The shortest passage was by the ‘⁴ Flying Cloud'’ that crossed between 1200 and 1250 in October3 the
next shortest was by the ‘⁴ Sword Fish” that crossed between 1100 and 1150 in J anuary; and the next from
the same crossing by the ‘⁴ Surprise'' in March. -

In J uly the best average—and ⁴⁴ bad’s the best'’-—-is between 1000 and 1050, 131 dayS. In October it is
sor the same crossing with 116 days, In November from the same with 122 dayS.

The crossings that give the shortest passages for each month are marked in table p. 441 with an asterisk (0.)

But these so called averages are derived sometimes from a single vessel; and sometimes the means of
comparing the passages at one crossing with those at another, are wanting. For instance, we have no record
of any vessel that crossed the line between 900 and, 950 in any month, except one in March and November.
Between 950 and 1000, we have two sor May, and one only for February and October each. Therefore we
have not the means of instituting any satisfactory comparisou as to the advantages of crossing in these months
between 950 and 1000, with the advantages of crossing between 1000 and 105ος οι· between 1100 and 1150,
or elsewhere in the same months,

In January there is no vessel that crossed East of 1050. We have two that crossed between 1050 and
11003 four that crossed between 1100 and 1150 ; and one between 1150 and 1200.

The shortest passage to the Line ror-any mouth from the United States was 'by the ‘⁴ Flying Cloud,’' and
the ‘⁴ Sword Fish,” each of 71 dayS.

The ⁴‘ Sword Fish” crossed in 1100 iu August, she had 20 days thence to San FranciscO. The ‘⁴ Flying
Cloud ” crossed at 1240 in August, and had 19 days thence to port. The shortest trip yet from the Equator
to· San Francisco was made in 14 days by the ‘⁴ WhiteVSqualW—she crossed at 1180 W. in December. The
next shortest is the ‘⁴ Comet,” srom Long. 1170 in December, the ⁴⁴ Mary Reed” from 115 in J anuary, each
of 16 dayS.

In February there are no means of comparing crossings to the East of 1050. F1ve vesseIS, however,
crossed between 1050 and 1100 W.‚ of which the shortest to the Line was the ‘⁴ Hazard,’' 107 dayS, in Long.
110ος and the shortest from the Line was the ⁴⁴ Helena,'' 21 days, she crossed at 1100. Between the meridians
of 1100 and 1150 there were two crossings in February, and between 1150 and 1200, one. This vessel, the

‘⁴ Seamen,’' clipper, crossed in 1180 with 87 days from the United States to the Line, and 18 thence to San

Francisco.
