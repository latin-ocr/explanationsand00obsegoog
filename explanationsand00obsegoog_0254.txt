motion of the given limits, to know which of the limit number is the time os highest water, when the moon is

in the quarters and the sun near the equator ς but as the diurnal wave disappears when the sun is in the equa·
tor, and then both the observed high waters during the same day are equal, there is no difficulty in it, because
both the high waters under such circumstances are, for the navigator, equally high.—

The depths in the Charts qfthe Chonnels to Scarabaya are Rhynland feet, 1 Rhynl'd feet—0314 metre

1 English feet—0305 metre

The feet I hereafter mention are always Rhynl'd feet. All the depths in Dutch charts are in those feet
or in fathoms of 6 such feet. Every foot has 12 incheS.

During the time the sun is in or near the equator the highest water rises with full and change 8 feet, and
in the quarters only 6 feet abo've the depths put in the Chart.

When the sun's declination is the greatest, the highest water rises with full and change 9} feet, and in the
quarters δὲ feet above the depths of the Chart.

The smaller higli water rises during the equinox like the other high water 8 feet by full aud change, and
6 feet in the quarters; but in the other months it rises above the depths of the Chart ε

In May with full and change δὲ feet and in the quarters 53 feet.

This 'entrance is filled up with a large bank, called “ Zeebanlc‚'' (Seabank‚) through which there are two
channels, one called the old—now abandoned—channa, the other the new charmel?
During the months in which the sun is in or near the Equator, in March, April, Septembre, and Octobre‚
there are with full and change, two high waters every day, but in the quartem, during those months, it is, as
in all other months of the year, only once a day high water, which takes place when the sun’s declination

is north in the day time, and when south at night.

In the following months high water will be found in:
