business to collect materials for the great work I have in hand. The first attempt to penetrate the depths of t
the ocean encouraged further exertionstieutenant Walsh's deep sea sounding invested the subject with
renewed interest, and when it was officially brought to the notice of the lamented Commodore Warrington,
the Chief of Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography‚ and of his successor, Commodore Mortis, under whose
orders Ι am, they both at once gave it their hearty approval and official sanction.

The following circular order to the commanders of all vessels of the Navy was thereupon issued z

Sm ε Your attention is particularly invited to the accompanying directions relative to deep sea soundings.

You will take care 3that they be diligently and faithfully carried out on board the vessel under your command.

You will report‚ from time to time, to this Bureau, the latitude, longitude, depth, drift, time, and all the
circumstances connected with each cast, whether successful in reaching bottom or not—stating the kind of
sinker used, its weight, and whether the large or small twine was used.

This order is to supersede that of June lst, 1850, on the same subject, and the directions given at pages

'70 and 71 of Maury’s 3d edition of Sailing Directions, so far as they may conflict with these.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Directions sor taking Deep Sea SoundingS, prepared by the Bureau <ff Ordnance and Hydrography, under tlte
authority of the Secretary qf the Navy.
For the purpose of ascertaining the depth of the sea, and determining the shape of the great oceanic
basinS, every vessel in the Navy will be provided with a quantity of twine and leadS, or instead of the lead a
round 32-pdr. shot may be used.

The twine furnished to each vessel is of two kinds· The sinaller is on reels of 10,ooo fathoms to a reel;
it is capable of bearing a weight of 70 le. ; it is marked at every l,000 fathoms with white (saddler’s) silk,
one knot standing for 1,000 sathomS. These lengths are subdivided by marks at every 200* fathorns. The

200 and 400 fathom mark between every l,000, being osred silk3 and the 600 and 800 each of black.
For the knots and round turns by which the 260, the 400, the 600 and 800 fathoms are told, officers are ⁶

referred to the twine on the reel, and the marks themselveS.

The smaller twine is to be used when the depth and other circumstances appear unfavorable for recover-

ing the lead.

 

‘lt has been found most convenient to mark every 100 sathoms.
