until they get south of the equatur. A few caste in mid-ocean on the homeward route from around the
Cape of Good Hope‚ extending all the way up to the eiquator, and even thence homeward in the North Atlantis,

would possess much value. So also those coming from around Cape Horn, as they return homeward‚ without
touching at Rio. They should endeavor to sound at intervals of250 or 300 miles all the way home, and in both
the North and South Atlantic3 vessels of the African or Brazil Squadron‚ should, having regard to the soundings
already made, sound at every suitable time and place. 'l'hey should do this especially in crossingthe ocean, on
their passage from one station to another, and in going to, and returning from their cruising grounds. But the

great field to which the attention of commanding officers is invited, as they pass to and fro, between the United
States and their cruising grounds in the Pacific Ocean, China Scae, δια, is South of the parallel of 350 or

40Ο S. Soundings there, and along their cruising groundS, are particularly recommended to their attention.

With regard to the frequency with which casts should be had for deep-sea soundings, when the ocean is
more than 1‚000 or 2‚000 fathoms deep, it may be remarked, that unless in arms and bights and gulfs and
haye, etc., as the Gulf of M exico and Caribbean sea, it is not generally required to repeat soundings within lese
than 250 or 300 miles of each other3 and that commanding officers may know where soundings have been ob·
tained, 1 have inserted the table, page 206, which gives all the deep-sea soundings reported up to the time of
going to prese. When the weather will admit of deep-sea soundingS, it is recommended that a boat should be
lowered‚ and having been anchored with a pot, that a sounding should be taken from her. In the South
Seas no attempt should be made in blue water, and in unknown depthS, South of the parallel of 350 S.,
without having at least 7,000 or 8,000 fathoms of twine on the sounding reel.

The theory of the tides calls for knowledge as to the depths of the ocean. With all the earnestness
admissible, therefore, Ι venture to press this subject upon the attention of those officers who hold the respon-
sible and honorable position of commanding an American man-of·war. The eyes of the scientific men of the
world are upon them, expecting light upon this great physical question.

Among the physical problema os the day, few would by their practica] demonstration be considered of higher
interest than would the solution of the problem concerning the depths of the ocean. The means of solving
that problem have, with a liberality and enlightenment of view beyond all praise, been placed in the hands of
American navy officere, and in their hands alone. 'They are commended by their Government to use these
means, and it is their duty to do it, as Ι am sure it will be their pleasure and their pride. They may expect,

therefore, that not only the wise and good men of their own, but the servans of all countries have their eyes
upon them, and will look with interest for their reporta.

Any officer thr-owing away these rare opportunities of collecting knowledge and information for the use

of the world and the good of mankind, or neglecting his bounden duty in the premises, will be held by good·
men everywhere to a severe public opinion. Therefore, 1 am earnest in urging this subject upon the atten-

tion of every brother officer.
Let us now return to the table of soundingS, page 206.

There is a general agreement in the “ Albany's'’ soundings of December eth and leth, and the second one
