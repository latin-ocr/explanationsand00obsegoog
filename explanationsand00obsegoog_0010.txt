viewed in this light in Germany by all persons who have a taste for physical geograpby. In an analogous
way anything of isothermal countries (countries of equal annual temperature,) has for the first time become
really fruitful, since Dove has taught us the isotherms of the several months chiefly on the land; since two-
thirds of the atmosphere rest upon the sea, Maury’s work is so much the more welcome and valuable because
it includes at the same time the oceanic currentS, the course of the winds and the temperature. How remark·-

' able are the relations of temperatures‚ in Sheet No. 2, South Atlantic, East and West of Longitude 40 ; how
much would this department of meteorology gain if it were filled up according to Maury’s proposition in
Commodore Lewis Warrington’s Log Book. The shortening of the voyage from the United States to the
Equator, is a beautiful result of this undertaking. The bountiful manner in which these Obarts are distributed
raises our expectations still higher.'’—-Baron Von Humboldt to Dr. Flt‘a‘gel, U. S. Consul, Leipsic.

1t is not for the benefit of navigation alone that seamen are invited to make observatione and collect ma·
terials for the wind and Cur-rent Charts; other great interests besides those of commerce have their origin in
the ocean or the air3 and, without doubt, these interests are to be benefited by a better knowledge than we
now'have of the laws which govern the circulation of the atmosphere, and regulate the movements of the
aqueous portions of our planet.

The agricultural capacities of any place are as dependent upon the hygrometrical as upon the thermome-
trical condition of the atmosphere. This is obvious, and of easy illustration:

Each kind of plant requires for its most perfect development a certain degree of moisture, and the winds
which bring it that moisture can only get it from the sea or other evaporating surfaces.

It is osten argued because wine and olives, or other staples, are produced upon a given parallel of
latitude, that therefore they should be produced upon the same parallel wherever the proper soil is to be found.

WhereaS, the consideration as to the route which the winds from the ocean have to pursue in order to
reach the situation of the supposed parallel, 1138 much to do with the case.

Virginia and California are between the same paralleIS, yet how different their agricultural resourceS, the
character and the ssavor of their fruitS, 311 owing not 80 much to difference of soil as to the way the winds blow,
the quantity of moisture they bring with them, the proportion os clouds and sunshine allotted to each place.

The system of researches embraced by the wind and Current Charts, therefore it would appear, concern
the philosopher and the husbandman, as well as the mariner, the merchant and the statesman.

A wider field, or one more rich with promise, has never engaged the attention of the philosopher. Though
much trodden and often frequented, it has never been explored, if we take exploration to mean the collecting
and grouping all those phenomena which mariners observe in relation to the ocean and the air above it, with
the view of tracing, in the true spirit of inductive philosophy, fact into effect, and effect up to cause.

The mariner, therefore, should bear it always in mind when he is making and recording out upon' the wide

ocean an observation in connection with these ChartS, that upon the fidelity with which 'that observation and the

record of it are made, depends the ability here to read aright the workings of those physica] agents that are

employed in the grand scheme of creation, to produce those results which are the subjectos observation with him.
