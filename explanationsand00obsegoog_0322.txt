What 1 have seen, therefore, 1 do profess to know and understand3 3ηά in my reminiscences west of Cape
Horu, where I have spent (on board ship) thirty years of the best of my lise, it will not, I trust, be deemcd

presumptuou3‚ should 1 rely upon, and boast a little of, great experience in that region.”

 

In this stage of my investigations into the habits of the whale‚ I have thought it best to give the soregoing
letters without any commenta of my own. They possess much interest and have a peculiar value. 1 quote
them, not for the purpose of exciting discussion among naturalists, but for the purpose of eliciting further in-
formation from the whalemen themselves; hoping that these last will be induced to go more into detail, and

give us all the information which they possess; and among such a number of close observers there is no doubt

much to be elicited that is truly valuable. Ι need not add that naturalists would be thankful to any whaleman
who will furnish them with a specimen of the hair with which we are informed by Captains Post and McKenzie
ffiat whales are covered.

It is proper to remark that 1 infer the figures os the whales (Plate X) were drawn by Mr. Conklin fron
recollection‚ and that Ι have others of the same species drawn by F. H. Smith‚ which 1 presume were also
drawn from memory‚ and which resemble these so closely that there is no difficulty in recognizing the pictur-ea
of the different kind of whales as drawn by each. ¹

Captain Smith makes this difference, however: His profile of the Russian or Polar whale has a protru-
Berance in which the spout hole is inserted, whereas he represents the right whale as having no such feature.

Let us now return to the whale chart—letter F of the series·

By examining this chart it will, in its present state, serve to satisfy one at 3 glance that the favorite
haunts of the sperm whale are about the equatorial; of the right, about the polar regions. That near the
tropics is a sort os debatable ground, where the pasturage of the one overlaps the pasturage of the other. Am!
that on either hand a straggler from the one herd is occasionally found far over within the borders of the other.

1 have to request that whalem‘en when they come across these stragglers will. observe them closely. Do
they appear to be lost? what is their bodily condition, fat or lean ,² and what the contents os their stomach?
Are the straggIers generally male or female, and what is there that is peculiar about them?

The whale chart (series F) which comprises a chart of t'he world, Mercator’s projection of 10 degree: to
an inch at the equator, and which extends from Lat. 790 50‘ Ν. to 680 South, shows three places where the
sperm whale is in the habit of leaving the tropical regions and os resorting to higher latitudes. These places
are in the South Atlantic where they have been found in large schools between the parallels of 300 and 3503
in the South Pacific, between the parallels of 350 and 600 ;-—-and in the middle of the North Pacific as high
up as 400.

1 account for their presence up in the North Pacific by the “ Gulf Stream,” which has its genesis in the
Iadian ocean, and its exodus in the China seas. It carrieS, high up into the North Pacific ocean, the warm
waters and sea climate os the Tropics. And the sperm whale resorts there to enjoy it.

The sperm whale being found in the South Atlantic has suggested the inquit-‘y as to the temperatura· os the
ναίετε there—can there be a warm current in that part os the ocean? If so, whence does it come ?—from the

intertmpical regions os the Atlantic, or from the Indian ocean? or, is it a branch os the Lagullas current?
