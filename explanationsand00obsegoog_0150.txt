You will, therefore, confine your* attention to the routes already indicated.

The point of maximum cold is said to be in the vicinity of the Parry IslandS. To the north and wc

This opinion seems to be sustained by the fact that beasts and fowls are seen migrating over the ice
the mouth of Mackenzie River and its neighboring shores to the North. These dumb creatures are pro‘
led by their wise instincts to seek a more genial climate up‘on the borders of the supposed more open sea.

There are other facts elicited by Lieut. Maury, in the course of his investigations touching the wind
currents os the ocean, which go also to confirm the opinion that beyond the icy barrier which is generall
within the Arctic ocean, there is a Polinia, or sea sree from ice. You have assisted in these investigati‹

naval forces or officers of the Government, serving, in the waters of the Pacific, according to your nec«

In the event of your falling in with any of the British searching parties, you will offer them any ass
