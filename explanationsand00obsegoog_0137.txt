This vapor then which is taken up from the evaporating regions—by which is meant those regions where
the evaporation is greater than the precipitation‚—is carried by the winds through their channels of circulation
and poured back into the ocean where the regions of precipitation are 3-—and by the regions of precipitation
1 mean those parts of the ocean, as in the polar basius, where the ocean receives more fresh water in the
shape of rain, snow, δια, than it returns to the atmosphere in the shape of vapor.

In the precipitating regions-therefore, the level is destroyed, as before‘ explained, by elevation3 and inthe
evaporating regions, by depression3 which as already stated, gives rise to a system of surface currents moved
hy gravity alone from the poles towards the equatur.

But we are now considering the effects of evaporation and precipitation in giving impulse to the circula·
tion of the ocean where its waters are salt.

The fresh water that has been taken from the evaporating regions is deposited upon those of precipitation
which, for illustration merely, we will locate in the North Polar basin. Among the sources of supply of fresh·
water for this basin, we must include not only the precipitation which takes place over the basin itself, but also
the amount of fresh water discharged into it by the rivers of the great hydrographical basius of Arctic Europe,
Asia, and America. “ ⁰

This fresh water, being emptied into the Polar sea, and agitated by the winds, becomes mixed with the
salt3 but as the agitation of the sea by the winds extends to no great depth, it is only the upper layer of salt
water, and that to a moderate depth, which becomes mixed with the fresh. The specific gravity of this upper

layer therefore is diminished just as much as the specific gravity of the sea„water in the evaporating regions

was increased. And thus we have a surface current of saltish water from the poles towards the equator, and
an under current of water salter and heavier from the equator towards the poles· This under current supplies

in a great measure the salt which the upper current, freighted with fresh water from the clouds and rivers,

carries back.

Thus it is to the salts of the sea, that we owe that feature in the system of oceanic circulation which
causes an under current to flow from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic, and another from the Red sea into the
Indian ocean. And it is evident since neither of these seas is salting up,——that just as much, or nearly just
as much salt as the under current brings out, just so much must the upper currents carry in.

We now begin to preceive what a powerful impulse is derived from the salts of the sea in giving effective

and active circulation to its waters.
Hence, we infer that the currents of the sea, by reason of its saltness, attain their maximum of volume and

velocity. Hence, too, we infer that the transportation of warm water from the Equator towards the frozen regions
of the Poles, and of cold water from the Frigid towards the Torrid Zone, is facilitated3 and consequently
here, in the saltness of the sea, have we not an agent by which climates are mitigated—by which they are
sostened and rendered much more salubrious than it would be possible for them to be, were the waters of the

ocean deprived of this property of saltness,>

If these inferences as to the influence of the salts upon the currents of the sea, be correct, the same cause
