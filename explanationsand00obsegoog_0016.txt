10 THE wmn AND CURRENT CHARTS.

was drawn off, a constant concontration of brine' must occur, the proposition was laid down by the most dis-
tinguished of our GeologistS, and long held unquestionable, that huge accumulations of salt in masses larger
than all that Cheshire containS, were being formed in its depths. The doctrine eminently improbable in itself,
rs now met ΒΥ the discovery of an outward under-current, in all likelihood of brine. Itis matter os easy
demonstration, that without some such arrangement as this, the Red sea must long ere now have been con-
verted into one mass of salt, its upper waters at all events being known in reality to differ at present but little

in saltness from those of the Southern ocean. The Red sea forms an excellent illustration of all kindred
caSes, Here we have salt water flowing in perpetually through the straits os Babelmandeb, to furnish the sup-
plies for a mass of vapor calculated, were the strait shut up, to lower the whole surface of the· sea eight
feet annually,—and even with the open strait, to add to its contents a proportionate quantity of salt. But an

under current of brine, which from its gravity, seeks the bottom, flows out again to mingle with the waters

of the Great Arabian sea, where swept along ΒΥ currentS, and raised to the surface ΒΥ tides and shoaIS, it is
mingled by the waves through the other waters, which yearly receive the enormous monsoon torrentS, the
Concan and the Ghaut’s supply, become dilnted to the proper strength of sea water and rendered uniform in
their constitution, by the agitatior] of the storms which then prevail. Flowing back again from the coasts of
India, where they are now in exceSS, to those of Africa, where they suffer from perpetual drainage, the same
round of operations go on continually ; and the sea, with all its estuaries and its inletS, retains the same limit,
and nearly the same constitution, for unnumbered ages· A like check prevents on shore the extreme heating
and desiccation from which the ground would otherwise suffer. The earth is a bad conductor of heat ε the
rays of the Sun which enter its sursace, and raise the temperature to 100 or 1500, scarcely penetrate a foot
into the ground ; a few feet down, the warmth of the ground is nearly the same night and day. The moisture
which is there preserved free from the influence of currents of air, is never raised into vapor: so soon as the
upper stratum of earth becomes thoroughly dried‚ capillary action by means of which all excess of water was
withdrawn, ceaseS, and even under the heats of the tropicS, the soil two feet down will be found on the approach
of the rains sufficiently moist for the nourishment of planta. The splendid flowers and vigorous foliage
which burst forth in May, when the parched soil would lead us to look for nothing but sterility, need in no
way surprise us: fountains of water, boundless in extent and limited in depth by the thickness of the soil
which contains them, have been set aside and scaled up sor their use, beyond the reach of those thirsty winds

or burning rays which are suffered only to carry off the water which is superfluous, and would be perniciouS,

removing it to other landS, where its agency is required, or treasuring it up in the crystal vault of the firma-
ment, as the material of clouds and ‹lew—and the source, when the fitting season comes round again, os those
- deluges of rain which provide for the wants of the year.

“ Such are some of the examples which may be supplied of general laws operating over nearly the whole
sursace of the terraqueous globe. Amongst the local provisions ancillary to these, are the monsoons os India
and the land and sea-breezes prevalent throughout the tropical coastS. When a promontory such as that

of India intrudes into the region of the trade wind8‚ the continuous western current is interrupted‚ and in its
