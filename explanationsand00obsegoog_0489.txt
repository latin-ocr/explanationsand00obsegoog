Equatorial “doldrums”are often found between the Equator and 50 N. Between the meridians of 80⁰ and

850 West, in this part of the ocean, these winds and calms are found even in the months of J uly and August.

, Therefore, in coming out of Panama, and after crossing 50 N. in any season, make 3 S. W. course, if the

winds will allow. If the wind he S. W„ brace up on the starboard sack3 but if it be S. S. W„ stand West,
if it be a good working breeze. But if it be light and baffiing, with rain, know that you are in the “ doldrums,’'
and the quickest way to clear them is by making all you 333 33 3 (133 South course.

Suppose that aster crossing 50 Ν., you have got to the West of 850 without having crossed the Equator.
Now, if the time of the year be in that half which embraces J uly and December, the prevailing winds will be

between S. E. and' South inclusive, and the course is West as long as there is a breeze; as soon 33 the breeze

dies away, and you begin to fight the baffiing aits, conclude that you are in the vicinity of the “ doldrums’' that are
osten found here, either between the N. Ε. 3ηά S. E. trades, or between one of these trades and the system of
southwardly monsoons that blow North of the Line, and between the coast and the meridian of 950 West.

These belts of “ doldrums'' lie East and West, and the shortest way to cross them, is by 3 due North and-
South line3 therefore let it be 3 rule, whenever the navigator finds himself in one of these calm belts, to make
311 the latitude possible, for by that means he will soonest clear it.

Having crossed the meridian of 950, 313ηά away to the Northward 3ηά Westward with a free wind.

w est of Long. 1000, 3ηά between the parallels of 50 3ηά 100 N., the winds, in the months of November
3ηά December, are variable between N. E. and South, by way of East. In J anuary, February, 3ηά March they
are quite steady as N. Ε. trades· In April they are variable. The doldrums are generally found

between those parallels in this month. During the rest of the year the winds are all the time between S. E.

3ηά S. W.
It will be well to cross the parallel of 100 N. at least as far West as the meridians of 1050 or 1100 W.

Here, between the parallels of 50 3311 100 Ν., the winds in November are steady from S. S. Ε. 3ηά S. De·
cember, April, and May are the months for the “doldrums’' in this part of the ocean. ⁴

California. See Sailing Directions for California.

lfl'making the West coasts of Mexico and the United 813133, the kelp is said to form 33 excellent land-
mark. This weed is very long and grows on the rocks at ‘the bottom. When, therefore, in approaching the
coast, you come across lines or swarths of tangled kelp, its being tangled or matted is a sign that it is adrift.
Itis afloat in deep water, and you may sail boldly through it without sear. But when you come across it
tailing out straight, it is then fast to the rocks at the bottom, and it is dangerous to get among it.

The sketches of headlands along this coast, marked A, Β, O, D, E, and F, were kindly furnished me by
Lieut. Simon F. Blunt, and Passed Mid’n A. W. Johnson, U. S. N., those marked G. (West Coast of Africa,
by Lt. Porter, U. S. N. To all three of those gentlemen 1 take this opportunity of acknowledging my obliga-

tions for this useful information and much valuable assistance.
