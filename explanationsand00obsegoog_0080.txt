of a thousand years, the Earth, the Suu and Moon, and every star is found to return to its proper place at the

proper moment.
Nay, philosophers tell ηε, when the little snow·drop, which in our garden walks we may now see raising

its beautiful head to remind us that spring is at hand, was created, that the whole mass of the Earth from pole
to pole, and from circumference to centre‚ must have been taken into account and weighed, in order that the
proper degree of strength might be given to the fibres even of this little plant.

Botanists tell us that the constitution of this plant is such as to require that at a certain stage of its
growth, the stalk should bend, and the flower should bow its head, that an operation may take place, which
is necessary, in order that the herb should produce seed after its kind ; and that after this its vegetable health
requires that it should lift its head again and stand erect. Now, if the mass of the Earth had been greater or
less, the force of gravity would have been different; in that case the strength of fibre in the sumn-drop, as it
is, would have been too much or too little3 the plant could not bow or raise its head at the right time; fecun-
dation could not take place, and its family would have become extinct with the first individual that was planted,
because its “seed’' would not have been “in itself,” and therefore it could not reproduce itself.

Now, if we see such perfect adaptation, such exquisite adjustment, in the case of one of the smallest
fiowers of the field, how much more may we not expect “compensation” in the atmosphere, upon the right ad-
justment andndue performance of which depends not only the life of that plant, but the well being of every indi-
vidual that is found in the entire vegetable and animal kingdoms of the world.

When the East winds blow for a little while, they bring us air saturated with moisture from the Gulf

Stream, and we complain of the sultry‚ oppressive, beavy atmosphere ; the invalid grows worse, and the well
man seels ill, because when he takes this atmosphere into his lungs, it is already so charged with moisture, that
it cannot take up and carry off that which encumbers his lungs, and which nature has caused to be deposited
there, that this atmosphere may take up and carry off. At other times the air is dry and hot3 he feels that it
is conveying off matter from the sungs too fast, he realizes the idea that it is consuming him, and he calls it
pareliing. ’

Therefore, in considering the general laws of atmospherical circulation, in order to get at the clue to them,
1 have felt mysels constrained to set out with the assumption, that if the atmosphere had had a greater or less
capacity sor moisture, or if the proportron of land and water had been different—if the earth, air and water,
had not been in exact counterpoise—the whole arrangement of the animal and vegetable kingdoms would have
varied from its present state. But God chose to make those ⁶'kingdoms what they are3 for this purpose it was
necessary, in his judgment, to establish the proportions between the land and water, and the desert, just as
they are, and to make the capacity of the air to circulate heat and moisture just what it is, and to have it to do
all its work in obedience to law, and in subservience to order. If the proportions of each were not adjusted
according to the reciprocal capacities of all to perform the functions required by each, why should we be told
that “He measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and comprehended the dust in a measure, and

weighed the mountains in scaleS, and the hills in the balance ?’' Why did be span the heavens, but that he
