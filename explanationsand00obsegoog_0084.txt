“ Most of this colored sheet 1 destributed to friends—a small portion remaining in my journal is sent

· herewith: though a poor specimen, as from frequent handling the darkest parts have suffered much. A

portion was sent to Professor Baily, at West Point, whose letter on the subject is now before me, dated
March 6th, 1847. He says: ‘ I eagerly examined the atmospheric dust, forI confidently expected to find
in,it some of the siliceous infusoria which Ehrenberg describe& 1 can, however, detect nothing but irregular
inorganic fragmentS, such as might come from minute volcanic dust. ²* ²* ²* ²* ²*

1 believe isa more advantageous mode of collecting it had been adopted, more interesting results might have
been obtained.'

“ The ground of this evening’s drop-scene—a light and dead yellow.

“ J anuary 17. Latitude 40 57¹ N., longitude 270 43¹ W. · Air at sunrise 78⁰. Water 790.5. Barometer
30.1. At noon, air 820—at 8 P. M. 790. wind slackening—yesterday it wavered as 1f about to leave us·
Sea smooth ; air balmy, but damp. Towards evening the solat disc shone through the dense mist unaccom·
panied with a single ray.’'

“ You will nOW, sir, be able to judge whether 1 am right or wrong in attributing the predominance of a
cream color, in these celestial paintings‚ to the atmospheric sea of dust through which we were for several
days sailing. tf they appear where it prevails not, Ι am of course mistaken. At any rate, they appeared not
till we entered, and after emerging from it, they were seen no more.

“ Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

This dust is also described by Ehrenberg and others, as of a brick red or cinnamon color, audit sometimes
comes down in such quantities as to cover the sails and rigging, though the vessel may be hu'ndreds of miles
from the land. This dust had generally been supposed to come, as its name importS, from Africa.

Now, the generous mariner‚ who has had the heart to sollow me around with “ the wind in his circuits‚'’
will perceive that proof is yet wanting to establish it as a fact, that the N. Ε. and S. E. trades, after meeting
and rising up in the equatorial calms, do cross over and take the tracks represented by C and G—Plate ΙΙ.

Statements and reasons and arguments enough, have already been made and adduced, to make it highly
probable, according to human reasoning, that such is the case3 and though the theoretical deductione showing ·
such to be the case, be never so good, positive proof that they are true, connot fail to be received with delight
and satisfaction.

Were it possible to take a portion of this air, as it travels down the S. E. trades, representing the general
course of atmospherical circulatim, and to put a tally on this portion of atr, by which we could always

recognise it again, then we might hope, actually, to prove by evidence the most positive, the channels through

which the air of the trade winds, after ascending at the equator, returns whence it came.
