The question then comes up3 Does the Atlantic afford evaporating surface sufficient to supply all the
rivers of Europe and America with rain water? and, iss-0, by what winds do the vapors, that make these rainS,
travel both East and West from the same place?

Very little of America and no partos Europe is within the region of the N. E. trade winds; and the tradeS,
because they come from a colder and go to a warmer climate, are eminently evaporating winds. But how is it

to the North of the N. E. trade windS, wlfre, on the surface of the earth, the S. W. are the prevailing winds?

Here, as a general remark, the winds are going from a warmer to a colder climate, and therefore ought, it
would seem, to precipitate more than they evaporate. Thus, take the isotherm of 600 Fahr. in the Atlantic,
as an example: the mean dew point, we will suppose along this line, is between 500 and 600, or at any other
degree below 600—suppose 550—that we may choose for the illustration.

Now let us proceed still further North in this ocean until we reach the isotherm of 300 ε on this line the
mean dew point must be below 300, ‘how much we cannot say, nor is it material for the illustration that we
should say. It is certainly below the mean dew point of 600. Now what becomes of the vapor that has caused
the mean dew point of the isotherm of 600 to change to that which belongs to the isotherm of 300? It has
been precipitated‚ and the capacity of the air to retain moisture has been lessened proportionably. In thus
viewing the case, the question arises: Whence are the vapors taken which supply with rain the sources of the
rivers of the North temperate and frigid zones?

You will understand me as speaking in general termS, without regard to any of the exceptions caused by
anomaliae, such as the Gulf Stream and the like.

Where the N. Ε. and S. Ε. trade winds⁶meet, they produce what is known as the belt of equatorial calms.
This is one of the valves in the great atmospherical machine, through which the air that is brought {rom the
North and the South by these trade windS, rises and escapes into the upper regions of the atmosphere, and ⁶
thence returns to supply the sources of the trades with fresh air to make more winds of.

Now the question is: Does the air which is brought to this valve by the S. Ε. trades continue on towards
the North in the upper regions of the atmosphere, while that which comes down as the N. E. trades con·

'tinues on towards the South in like manner? or does the air which the S. E. trades bring to this calm place,
rise up and-return to the South? or does the air of the two trades intermingle here, and go, a part of it indis·
criminately, either to the North or to the South as chance may determine?

·1 am inclined to favor an affirmative reply xto the first of these interrogatories; and for these reasons, in
addition to those already alluded to:

lst. Winter, late fall, and early spring, are the seasons os our greatest precipitation3 and this is the time
when the sun is pumping up the vapor with the greatest energy from the southern, and with the least from the
northern oceans—and so too when the sun is pumping up vapor from the northern hemisphere with all his en·
ergies, precipitation is most active in the southern.

ed. The belt or band over which the S. E. trades prevail is much broader than that over which the N. E.
