mouth, the calms are generally between the equator and 4ο Ν., and it takes a vessel 6 days on the average to
cross them.

Ι have thus taken the trouble to quote a number of passages for every mouth of the year and by each route,
that navigators may the better judge for themselves as to the merits of the two routeS.

It will be observed that the length of the passage by both routes, depends very much upon the season:
J uly and the old route giving the greatest average, which is 48 days3 the most tedious month by the new route
is August, which gives 41 days as the average.

In January there is but little difference between the two routes according to the passages quoted, though
according to my investigatione, the average passage ΒΥ the new J anuary route should be less than 30 days ;
and when it comes to be tried fairly, such, 1 expect, will be the result.

February and March are famous months for quick passages. The new route saves about two weeks on
the average sor each of these months.

When a vessel finds herself pinched sor room, she should never hesitate to pass inside of Femando do

Noronha3 and vessels bound around the Cape of Good Hope, will find it to their convenience to cross the
equator further to the East than they would is bound to South America or around the “ Horn.''

I bave heard complaints of the new route from but two vessels that have returned me abstracts of their
logs, so that Ι might judge whether their complaints were well grounded. These two vessels were the
“ Oceanu8,” in 1848, and the “ Clarissa Perkins,” in 1849. And it is but just to remark that the complaint,
as to the “ Perkins,” comes from others, and not from her master.

Ι do n‘ot claim for vessels on the new route an exemption either from head winds, baffling airs, or calms.
On the contrary, Ι expressly show that vessels on the new route are liable to all these. Nor do I claim for the
new route short passages invariably. 1 only claim that the‘average of the passages by the new route will be
shorter than the average of the passages by the old. 1 could name a fine sailing frigate, that had a passage
to Rio of 100 days by the old route. 1 could cite the case of other public vesseIS, that have had like passages,
and of merchant vessels that have had 150 days ΒΥ the old route. But these are the exceptions and not the
rule. So doubtlesS, too, there may be occasionally long passages by the new route.

But to show that it is not the fault of the new route that the “ Oceanus„ had a passage of 117 days to
Rio and the “ Clarissa Perkins” 83, 1 quote abstracts of their logs, ΒΥ which it will appear that there is every
reason to believe that both vessels would have had fair passages to Rio, if they had stuck to the new route.
