Australian Routes.

The gold ports of Australia, whether the distance be measured via Cape Hom, or by the way of the Cape
of Good Hope, are between 12,000 and 13,000 miles from the Atlantic ports of the United StateS. The best
way sor vessels in the Australian trade, from Europe or Amerina via the Atlantic, to gc, is by doubling the Cape
of Good Hope3 3ηά 1113 best way to come is, via Cape Horn; and for this reason, viz: The prevailing winds in
the extra-tropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere are from the N. W., which of course makes fair
winds for the outward bound around the Cape of Good Hope, and fair winds for the homeward bound
around Cape Horn. Here all is plain sailing; vessels homeward bound should steer straight fur Cape Horn,
and the outward bound, aster doubling the Cape of Good Hope‚ should shape their course as direct for the port
of destination, as the land and the winds will permit them.

Returning by the way of Cape Horn homcward, the best route is to get south of the parallel of 40Ο 33
soon as you can, and then shape the course direct sor Cape Horn, recollecting that the further you keep south
of the middle of the straight line on your chart from Van Dieman’s land to Cape Horn, the nearer you are to
the Great Circle route, and the shorter the distance. Τ 113 difference by the Great Circle‚ and by the straight
course on the chartS, being upwards of 1,000 mileS.

1111113 passage from Australia to Cape Horn, by keeping between the parallels of 400 3ηά 600 all the
way, you will, 1 am of the opinion, feel more or lesS, the warmth and set of 3 current that passes south of
Australia from the Indian Ocean. VVhether the boisterous weather to which a warm current in such latitndes
would give rise, will compensate for the advantages to be gained in other respectS, must be lest for experience
to determine. For my own part, 1 do not suppose this current to be as strongly marked as is our Gulf stream

in the Atlantic; though the passage from the Capes of the Delaware to Liverpool may be considered as

affording us the means of judging pretty accurately as to this passage from Australia—the chief difference

being, I suppose, in the climate 3ηά 1113 gales.

The climate in the Pacific along this route will be found not quite so mild as is that along the European
route in the Atlantic. But the gales in the Atlantic are probably more frequent and violent than they are in
the Soutb Pacific—at any rate 1 suppose that such will be found to be the case, until you reach the regions of
Cape Horn.

Tne Australian routes present occasional opportunities sor fine 111113. In the South Pacific Ocean, below
‘the parallelos 35ο or 40Ο S. and away from the influence of the land—as along this route, especially from New
Zealand to Cape Horn— the westerly winds blow almost with the regularity of the trades ; and a fast vessel taking
3 westerly gale as she clears the New Zealand IslandS, may now and then run along with it pretty nearly to Cape
Horn, or taking it on the outward passage aster clearing the Cape of Good Hopc—-by keeping well south—may
run along with it to Van Dieman’s land.

The great circle distance from South Australia to California is about 7,000 miles, and vessels in the direct

trade between Australia 3ηά 1113 Pacific coasts of the United States may have the choice of routes going as well
