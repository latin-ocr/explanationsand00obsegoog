In the spring of 1849, she went out again. She had 32 days to the Line in 280, ’after having been de·
layed 9 days by calms between 5⁰ N. and, the Line, whence, in 3 dayS, she again cleared 'Cape St. Roque.
The average therefore of Capt. J ackson’s passages to the Line, by the New Route, was 30 days, against 41
by the Old Route.

The “ Chicora,” the “ Helena‚” and the “ Midas‚'’ tried this route about the same time, and all with
equal success; their average to the Line being 26 days only.

These practica} demonstrations of the advantages of the route which I had pointed out were not wanting
to satisfy me of their value, for 1 had consulted many thousand records as to the vinds encountered in this part
of the ocean by different vessels on different occasions, These records show the number of times on which
the winds had been found to blow from each point of the compass in different parts of the ocean. And know·
ing the prevailing winds for each 5 degrees square, the navigator could tell what course it was practicable for
ιι vessel to steer through these squareS, as well before as after the trial had actually been made.

For instance, in a certain square of ’ 5 degreeS, I obtained the records of 700 vessels during the month ol
August in different years, Vessels bound South by the old route, were in the habit of passing through this
square, always aiming to make a S. S. W. or south course through it. And of these 700 records as to the
wind, 600 gave the wind directly abead for the South or S. S. W. course. To convince any one, then, who
believes in the recor-ds examined, that a vessel in this part of the route to Rio would generally find the winds
’ abead, did not require that a vessel should be sent there actually to try-it, for here was the experience of 700
vesseIS, 600 of which had found the winds adverse for 3 southerly course.

But certain navigators were not disposed to look upon my investigations in this light. Forgetting that
they were the results of actual observations, these persons were disposed to consider those results thus an·
nounced, as theorieS, or matters of opinion of my own3 whereas they are no more matters of opinion than is
the fact that the trade winds blow is a matter of opinion. They are nothing more nor less than the sum of
the experience of some thousands of navigator-S, as to winds and calms.

The effect has been, that though many shiprnasters have at once perceived the bearing of these results,

and the correctness of the conclusions derived from them, and have readily adopted them, still others have re·

jected thern altogether, or only partially adopted them.
1t has not unfrequently happened, as I perceive by the Log·books returned to me, that a navigator will

put to sea and stand boldly out for the new route. But after awhile, the wind comes out abead. He then
gets frightened, abandons it, has a long passage, and lays the blame to the ne‘w route.

1 have never claimed for any of these routes an exemption from liability to-head winde. On the contrary,
1 expressly show that a vessel by any of the routes proposed by me is liable both to head winds and calms ;

and not only so, Ι have shown the chauces of both against her.
1 may here remark thatI have never yet heard of a navigator complaining of the new route and a long

passage by it, but what, when his abstract Log came to be examined, it did not appear that the fault was quite

as much with him as with the route. For instance, 1 have drawn certain lines or tracks to show the route
