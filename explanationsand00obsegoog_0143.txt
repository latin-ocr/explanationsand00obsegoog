The dews, the rains and the rivers are continually dissolving certain minerals of the earth, and carrying

them off to the sea. This is an accumulating process3 and if it were not compensated, the sea would finally

*become as the Dead Sea is, saturated with salt, and therefore unsuitable sor the habitation of many fish of the sea.

The sea shells and marine insects affor-d the required compensativa. As the salts are emptied into the sea,
these creatures secrete them again and pile them up in solid masseS, to serve as the bases of islands and con-
tinentS, to be in the process of ages upheaved into dry land, and then again dissolved by the dews and rains and
washed hythe rivers away into the sea.

Darwin‚ many years ago,* during one of those moments os inspiration which enabled him to soreshadow
the steamboat and the locomotive‚ told philosophers whence came the salts of the sea.

In every department of nature there is to be found this sels-adjusting principle—this beautiful and ex-
quisite system ofssompensation by which the operations os the grand machinery os the universe are maintained
in the most. perfect order.

Thus we behold sea shells and animalculae in a new light. May we not now cease to regard them as
beings which have little or nothing to do in maintaining the harmonies of creation? On the contrary, do we
not see in them, the principles os the most admirable compensation in the system os oceanic circulation ἓ We
may even regard them as regulators‚ to some extent, of climates in parts os the earth far removed from their
presence. There is something suggestive, both of the grand and beautiful, in the -idea that while the insects

of the sea are building up their coral islands in the perpetual summer of the tropicS, they are also engaged in

dispensing warmth to distant parts of the earth, and in mitigating the severe cold of the Polar winter.

 

ἢ Gnomes! You then taught transuding dews to pass,
Through time -t'all’n woodo, and root-inwove morans
Age after age3 and with filtration fine
Dispart from cartha and sulphure and saline.
Hence with diffusive salt old ocean steepo

¹ His emer-ald shallows, and his sapphire deepsk
Ost in wide lakes, around their warnier brim,
In hollow pyramidi! the crystals swiin 3
Or, fused by earth-born sires in cubic blocks,
Shoot their white forms, and hai-den into rocks.
Thus caverned round in Cracow’s mighty mines,
With crystal walls, a gorgeous city shinen
Scooped in the briny rock, long sti-aits extend
Their hoary course, and glittering domes ascend3
Down the bright stceps, emerging into day,
impetuous sountains burst their headlong way,

O’er milk-white vales in ivory channels spread,
And wandering‚ seek their subterraneous bed,

Formed in pellucid salt with chinel nice,

The pale lamp glimmering through the sculptured ἰᾶος
With wide reverted eyes fair Lotta stands,

And spreads to Heaven, in vain, her glassy hand-’2
Cold dews condense upon her pearly bremt,

And the big tear roll· lucid down her vent.
