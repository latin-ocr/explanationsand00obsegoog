Here she appears to have got regularly into the Westerly Trades. And now it is not difficult to cast
back and see how much the elever master of this ship would have gained, if he had bad these sailing
directions before him3 or if on the 18th J uly, he had stood away a little to the eastward of south, reaching the
parallel of 450 somewhere about 250 or 300 west, and then edging up East, but still keeping to the

southward.

The nearer the poles the shorter the degrees of longitude.
Ships intending to take this route should be well manned and found, that they may stand the bolsterouS,

rolling, and rough-weather run that may be expected along this route of fair winda.
