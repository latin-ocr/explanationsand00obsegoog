are requested to note in the Abstract Log.

Plate XIII is 3 section taken from the whale chart os the world. It is a copy, and nearly a fac-simile,
except that in some of the chartS, the Right whale curves are colored blue. 3ηά the Sperm, red. Takc the
square marked A. as an illustration 3ηά explanation os the chart. Between the meridiana of 450 and 500 W.—
as between every fifth pair os meridians—are 12 columns for the 12 months ; the first column on the left always

standing sor December, or the first Winter mouth, the next tfor J anuary‚ and so on.

Between the parallels of 350 and 400 3ι·3 11 horizontal 11333. Beginning always at the South and count·
ing up towards the North, each of the first ten os these lines stands for 10 days, thus making the 1oth stand
for 100. The scale is then changed3 the llth line stands {or 2003 and the 12th on the parallel of Lat„ sor
300 days. See the figures in the margin.

Now by following the curve for the days, and the curve for the whales‚ Right and Sperm, for this square—-
it will be seen that during different years, whaJers have spent in this square upwards of 100 days (125) searching
for 'hales in the mouth of December; and that out of this time, they saw ‘Right whales on 15 days—Spem

on 2 ; and that during each mouth they have fished and seen 33 follows, viz:

Daya of Search. No. of day· on which were seen—

It appear-⁰0, therefore, that from September to December inclusive, is the best time for whaling in this dis·
trict of 50 square. In some of its neighboring districts, whalers have been more successful in other month3‚
33 3 glance at the chart will show.

Itis worthy of remark that the Sperm whale, according to the results of this chart, appears never to
double the Cape of Good Hope. He doubles Cape Horn. Since this fish delights in warm water, shall we

not expect to find off Cape Horn, 33 under current of warm water, beavier with its salts?
