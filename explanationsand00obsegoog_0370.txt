In April, we have for comparison six tracks by the old and eleven by the new route, with 811 average saving
of more than a week in favor of the latter-3 notwithstanding the bad luck of the “ Chalcedony.'' That 188881,
when she got to the equatorial 081018, committed the mistake of going too far east. She went as far as 240
and was 32 days in the “ doldrumS,” between latitude 20 and 6Ο N. This is the longest passage, of which 1
have received any account, by 1118 new route. It might be rejected because of the departure from this route in
going so far to the eastward, but this is a mistake which navigatorS, I find, are liable to make ; and, therefore,
1 have preferred to count it. On the other hand, if extraordinary long passages by the old route had been
sought for, they might have been found of more than 100 days in length. l

So, too, with the Brig R. de Zaldo. She was becalmed for 13 days in the “ Horse Latitudes,” between
latitude 34Ο and 360 N., and 5 days in the equatorial calmS, between 40 N. and the Line ; also, the “ Wash·
ipgton Allston.” She went 88 far as 220 W., and was seven days becalmed 111 1118 equatorial “ doldrums,’'
between 50 N. and the Line.

Now, if these vessels, with the ·light southerly windS, which they met after losing the N. Ε. trades, had not
been afraid of falling to leeward, so 88 1101 10 weather Cape St. Roque, they no doubt would have done much
better.

Instead os running obliquely, say an E. or an! E. S. E. course along the equatorial 081018, they should
have endeavored to beat due South across the Line, so as to get clear of them in the least time possible. By
fanning along to the eastward, they got into that part of the ocean where these calms are most obstinate.

Is, therefore, we omit these three vessels from the count, as not coming justly within the rule, we shall
have a differ-enee of 13 days in favor of the new route sor this month. But retaining them, there is still a dir-

serence of more than a week in favor of the new route for April.
&ev-The new route is much less liable to calms than the old.

 

FOR. MAY.

   
   
    

 

  

NEW ROUTE. OLD ROUTE.
