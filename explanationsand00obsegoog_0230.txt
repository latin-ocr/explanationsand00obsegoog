01 impediment whatever, for which success we 313 indebted to-—after the markers of the line (Plum & Co.,)

and the admirable reel-——the hints given us by the experience of Lieut. Taylor in the “ Albany ;'' an of his pre·
cautious having been adopted by us, Mr. J. Higgings‚ our master, is a young man os fine qualifications in his
profession, 3ηά 8331118 anxious to get at satisfactory results in these experiments. In Lat. 330 55¹ N„ Long.
520 34( W.; Temp. air 640, water 65ος we got a fair up and down sound of (2‚600) twenty-six hundred
fathoms of line—(2700) twenty-seven hundred fathoms 0111. Time of running out, 1 hour 23 minutes 10
seconds‚ and botiom without a doubt. It was very nearly a calm, and aster hauling in about 100 fathoms of
line, it “ grew up and down ;” the line did not part till we had reeled 400 1311101118, losing 2,300 fathoms of line,

The quartermasters and officers are of opinion, that if the ship had been perfectly steady, we might have
brought the shot up, but there being considerable swell on, when her stern listed, and rolled to leeward‚ she
brought such a sudden 8113111 011 the line that it snapped. While the shot remained on the bottom‚ I could
draw it along with my naked hand, but so soon as it lifted‚ I could not move it with a glove on, the weight

was so great, 3ηά 1113 pain to my 113ηά 80 severe. One of 0111· quartermasters‚ as strong a man as we have

‹ aboard, could not raise the shot απ inch, 31 2,000 fathoms depth.

I made 311 effort to get you a cast in the middle of the Guls Stream, but it was blowing so strong a gale
that 1 found it quite impossible to do any thing. In “ luffing to’' to take the third reef in our topsaiIS, we 1311
0111 3 thousand sathoms, but found 1131 drift so much, 3ηά 1113 motion so sudden 3ηά severe, that we snapped
the line. On the 28111 April, in Lat. 340 35’ Ν., Long. 670 41’ W., we brought the ship to, and ran out three
thousand sathoms of line in one 110111, without getting bottom‚ The line parted, after running all off the reel but
about forty fathoms. We have now 5,ooo fathoms on the reel, and after getting a few hundred miles deeper into
the Atlantic, Ι shall put on 7 ,000 sathoms in order to go beyond the greatest depth ever yet attained. 0111·
apparatus is so complete, that I see nothing to prevent it.

May 4th.-Sounded to-day in 'a calm—line got foul of the rudder, when 2,000 fathoms were out, 3ηά
parted—put two shot on to the remaining 3,000 fathoms, which ran out rapidly-—no 110110111-5,000 1311101118
11113 lost to-day. .

May 7th.-Wea1her‘too rough for sounding till to-day, From the first fair sound, which was “ up and
down,'' the officers have become very 11111311111131381311. To·day we sounded‚ and got bottom with five thou·
83ηά 3ηά five hundred (5,5oo) sathoms of line. Time of running out, 2 1101118 44 minutes 28 seconde. Lat
obs. 320 06’ N„ Long. 440 47¹ W. Drift‚ 3 1111138. Temp. air 660, water 680. Used two 32 pouud shot.
Lost 5,5oo sathoms of line. lt is difficult for us to say what our up 3ηά down sound was, The other sound

that 1 have given you, was almost in a calm, and the sound was “ up and down·‚’' and no mistake. After the

shot took the bottom to·day, the quartermaster held the line in his hand three miniates without any difficulty,
We all had a feel of it, and it was determined that no line would run off the 1331, but that taken off by the

ship's drift, and that she would take off by her drift the line as long 38 we would let it 11111; but of course
meh slower when on the bottom ,· this might not be the case, particularly when checked for three minuteS, with
the weight of two 32 pound shot attached, and 5‚000 fathoms of line out, if it was not on the bottom‚
