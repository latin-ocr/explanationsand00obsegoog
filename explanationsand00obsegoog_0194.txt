haul in as to induce me to believe that it had parted, until we filled away, when it soon became apparent that
the shot was fast. We shall seize the first convenient moment to try the experiment sr'om a boat. Itis
almost throwing away the materials to sound from a sailing ship in anything like a fresh breeze, and yet we
always reduce sail to topsails.

“ February 18t12, mbr—sailed from St. Jago de Cuha at 9 P. M. os the leth inst. At 1 P. M. this day,
in Lat. 150 40¹ N., Long. 7¹70 07¹ W.‚ got bottom with 1,300 sathomS, waxed line. Time of running about
17 minutes3 temp. air 8303-1emp. water 810. Drist, about one quarter of a mile.

‘⁴ This sounding is particularly satisfactory, as the ship was entirely still upon the water, at the moment
the line stopped. ’

“ February 19th, 1851.-At 5.30 Ρ. Μ. got bottom with 600 fathomS, waxed line, in Lat. 110 07’ Ν.,
Long. 790 13¹ W. Time of running '7 minutes 3 temp. air 820; temp. water 820. Drift at the rate of about
a mile an honr.

“ March 2d‚ 1851.-0n the 2oth ult., anchored at Chagres, from whence we sailed on the 2211. From
that date to the 28111, we were beating to the northward and eastward‚ in comparatively shoal water, and the
greater part of the time, the wind was blowin g a gale. On the 28th we kept away to the northward and westward‚

with a smashing breeze and a large sea on, which rendered sounding impracticable. The evening of the lst

afforded the only opportunity, but unluckily we were about passing between two‘dangerous shoaIS, (Baxo
Nuevo and Saranilla,) and it was important to keep our reckoning correct by running3 as it was, we did not
get through the difficulty until 9 P. M. This has been a favorable day for the operation, and accordingly at
1.30 P. M. we got a cast which resulted in giving us bottom with 895 fathoms. Time of running 12 minutes;
Lat. 1Ἷο 54’ Ν., Long. 800 25’ W.; temp. of air 84ος temp. of water 820. Drift about 200 yardS.

“ At bh. 15m. P. M. we got a second cast, which was taken in Lat. 180 06’ Ν., Long. 800 34’ W. We
found bottom with 680 fathoms line; time of running 7m. 45s.; temp. air 8303 temp. water 810.

“ The line was waxed in both experimentS. We never lose a shot now in starting the line, and our ex-
perience has taught us to overhaul the knots carefully, while waxing the twine, so that it parts less frequently
than formerly. Here are two points gained, at least.

“ March 3d, 1851.-The day has been passed in the vicinity of the Grand Cayman, where we have pro·
cured u supply of turtle, διο. for the crew. At 5.30 P. M.‚ when about 20 miles West of that island, we made
three unsuccessful experiments in sounding. The lst shot ran 6 minutes and parted with 660 fathoms out.
The 2d sliot ran 5 minutes and parted with 585 fathoms out. The 3d shot ran 33 minutes and parted with
37¹7 fathoms out. I can assign no cau-se for the repeated parting of the line, unless it be that it is of unequal

strength, and we have fallen upon a weaker portion than we have had of late. The next experiment may

throw some light upon the subject.

‘⁴ March· 4225, 1851.-At 5 Ρ. Μ. got bottom with 990 fathorns line 3 time of running 14 minutes 45 second33
Lat. 210 25’ N .‚ Long. 840 45¹ W.; temp. air 82ος temp. water 800.
