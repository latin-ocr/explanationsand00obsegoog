By dashing through the straitS, the “ Fish’' gained three days on the “ Gilpin ;” but here, fortune again de·
serted the “ Pigeon,” or rather the wiuds turned against her3 sor as she appeared upon the parallel of Cape Horn

and was about to double round, a westerly gale struck her and kept her at bay sor ten dayS, making little or no

way, except alternately fighting in a calm or buffeting with a gale, while her pursuers were coming up “ hand

over fist” with fine wiuds and flowing sheetS.
They finally overtook her, bringing along with them propitious gales. when all three swept past the Cape
and crossed the parallelos 510 South, on the other side of “the Horn ;‘' the “ Fish” and the. “ Pigeon” one da}¹

abead of the “ Gilpin.''

The “ Pigeon” was now, according the chartS, in the best position, sor she was in 850 W. ; the “ Gil-
pin'’ next, in 8403 and the “ Fish’' last, in 79ος but all were doing well.

From this parallel to the S. E. trades of the Pacific, the prevailing wiuds are srom the N. W. The po·
sition of the “ F ish‚’' therefore, did not seem as good as the otherS, because she did not have the sea room in
case of au obstinate N. W. gale.

But the wiuds favored her. On the 30th Dec. the three ships crossed the parallel of 350 8., the ‘⁴ Fish''
recognizing the “ Pigeon ;'' the Pigeon saw only a “ clipper ship,” for she could not conceive bow the ship in
sight could possibly be the ‘⁸ Flying Fish‚’' as that vessel was not to leave New York for some three weelrs
after she did ; the “ Gilpin” was only 30 or 40 miles off at the same time.

The race was now wiug and wiug, and had become exciting. With fair wiuds and an open sea, the
competitors had now a clear stretch to the Equator of two thousand five hundred miles before them.

The “ Flying Fish'’ led the way, the “ Wild Pigeon” pressiug her hard, and both dropping the ‘⁶ Gilpin’2
quite rapidly.

The two foremost reached the Equator on the 13th January‚ the “Fish’' leading just 25 miles and
