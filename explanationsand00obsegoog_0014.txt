the icebergs-—themselves gigantic glaciem, which have fallen from the mountains into the sea, or which have
grown to their present size in the shelter of bays and estuarieS, and by accumulations from above. Once
forced from their anchorage‚ the first storrn that arises drists them to sea, where the beautiful law which ren-
ders ice lighter than the warmest water enables it to float,—and drifts southward. a vast magazine of cold to
cool the tepid water which bears it along,—the evaporation at the equator causing a deficit, the melting and
accumulation of the ice in the frigid zone giving rise to an excess of accumulation, which tends along with
the action of the air, and other causes, to institute and maintain the transporting current. These stupendous
masseS, which have been seen at sea in the form of church spires and gothic towerS, and minarets, rising to
the height of from 300 to 600 feet, and extending over an area of not less than six square miles, the masses
above water being only one-tenth of the whole, are often to he found within the tropicS. A striking
fact dependant on this general law, has just been brought to light; there is a line extending from pole to pole,
at or under the surface of the ocean, where an invariable temperature of 39.5 is maintained. The depth of
this varies with the latitude3 at the equator it is 7‚200 feet—at latitude 560 it ascends to the surface, the tem·
perature of the sea being here uniform throughout. North and South of this the cold water is uppermost, and
at latitude 700 the line of uniform temperature descends to 4,500. But these, though amongst the most regular
and magnificent, are but a small number of the contrivances by which the vast and beneficent ends of nature

are brought about. Ascent from the surface of the Earth, produces the same change in point of climate, as an

approach to the poles; even under the torrid zone, mountains reach the line of perpetual congelation at nearly
a third less altitude than the extreme elevation which they sometimes attain: at the poles snow is perpetual
at the ground,·and at the different intervening latitudes, reaches some intermediate point of congelation‚ be-
twixt one and 2o,000 feet. In America, from the line south to the tropica, as also, as there is now every
reason to believe, in Africa, within similar latitudes, vast ridges of mountains covered with perpetual snow,
run northward and southward in the line of the meridian right across the path of the trade winds. A simi-
lar ridge‚ though of less magnificent dimensionS, traverses the peninsula of Hindoostan, increasi‘ng in altitude
as it approaches the line,—attaining an elevation of 8‚500 feet at Dodabetta, and above 6‚000 in Ceylon. The
Alps in Europe, and tho gigantic chain of the Himalayas in Asia, both far South in the temperate zone, streteh
from East to West, and intel-cept the aerial current from the North. Others of lesser note, in the equatorial or
meridianal, or some intermediate direction, cross the paths of the atmospherical currents in every direction,
imparting to them fresh supplies of cold, as they themselves obtain froin them warmth in exchange3 in strict-
ness, the two operations are the same. Magnificent and stupendous as are the effects and results of the water
and of air acting independently, on each other, in equalising the temperature of the globe, they are still more so
when-combined. One cubic inch of water when invested with a sufficiency of beat, will form one cubic
foot of steam—the water before its evaporation, and the vapor which it formS, being exactly of the same
temperature, though in reality, in the process of conversion, 1,7oo degrees of heat have been absorbed
or carried away from the vicinage, and rendered latent or imperceptible ; this heat is returned in a sensible

and perceptible form the moment the vapor is converted once more into water. The general fact is the same
