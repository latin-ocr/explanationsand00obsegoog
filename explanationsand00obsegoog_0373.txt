August is another bad and the worst mouth. Here, also, we have the tracks of nine vessels by the new
route. But the mean of them show an average gain of only 1.6 days to the equator, and of 2.1 to clear Cape
St. Roque. ⁴

The mean longitude of crossing the equator in this month is 290 30‘ by the new route, and 240 30‘ by the
old. From the former it requires only 2.4 on the average to clear Cape St. Roque3 whereas from the latter
3.2 days are required. In this fact navigators will see that there is no difficulty in orossing as far to the West
as recommended hy me sor this mouth. Fourteen days is the average of the time required· by those 9 vessels
to cross the belt of equatorial calms and monsoons; and every vessel, except 3, went further to the eastward
than is recommended by the route, and the average of these three in orossing this belt is 14 days· *

The “ Kathleen'' went as far as 240 West, and was 27 days becalmed in orossing this belt. The Inde·
pendence went, as was recommended, and was becalmed 18 days. Two others, 12 days each. The passage

for this month, when the new route shall be properly followed, will be considerably shortened.
