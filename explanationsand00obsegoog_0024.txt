This is an important subject. Many of the great inter-ests of state, and the well-being of the human
family, are to be advanced by increase of knowledge touching the dynamica] laws of the atmosphere, and the
distribution‘through it, over the surface of our planet, of electricity, heat and rnoisture.

For the fruits of his labor the husbandman is dependent upon atmospherical conditions; and commerce
is controlled by the course of the winds. The subject, therefore, is one of high scientific interest, and of
great national, industrial, and practical import. The step proposed hythe British Government is in the right
direction t wherefore, to make myself the more clearly understood, I may be excused for referring to the
meteorological system os the United StateS, and for offering a few suggestions amendatory of the British pro·
position.

The government of the United States has its own system of meteorological observations 3 one sor the

sea, another for the land.

Some of the StateS, as N ew York and MassachusettS, have, on their own account, established their system

of meteorological observations also.

A1s0‚ some of the institutions of the country, as the “ Smithsonian,’' and many of our fellow·citizens,
are likewise actively engaged in meteorological researches.

The meteorological observatories that are under the control of the different StateS, of the institutions and
of the private citizens of the United StateS, amount to several hundred. These extend from the shores of the

Atlantic to those os the Pacific, and from the farthest northern boundary to the extreme southern limits of the
United States.

Over these widely scattered observatorieS, and over this large corps of observers, their time for observa·
tion, their mode and means of observing, and their methods of recording the results os theirlabors, the govern-

nient of the United States has no control rwhateven nor can it exercise any, except such as may flow from

precept and example.

NevertheleSS. these observatorieS‚ both national, state 'and private, for the most part, act in concert. They
mostly employ the same instrumentS, refer to the same standards3 many of them ’observe at the same houm,
use the same methodS, and record by the same sormS, most of which differ more or less from those recommended
by Major General Sir John Burgoyne for the nineteen “foreign stations of the Royal EngineerS.”

I do not mean to draw comparisons, or to imply that, of the American and English systemS, one is better
than the other3 far from it. Each i's good; and is either be adopted, and made common to the two countrieS,
the science of meteorology would be vastly benefitted and advanced thereby.

If the government of the United States, therefore, without proposing amendments to the English system,

were to direct its officerS, who are engaged in meteorological observationQ to adopt the plan, modes and
methods of that system, it would create confusion among our observatorieS, and be as likely to retard as to
advance the progress os meteorological research in the United States·

For this reason I beg leave to suggest a meteorological conserence.

By authority os the government, Ι have been permitted to invite the co-operation os American shipmasters
