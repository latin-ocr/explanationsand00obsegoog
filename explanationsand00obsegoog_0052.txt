I have intimation of other results: that if this system of interrogating nature touching the laws by which

the circulation of the air and water is regulated, be patiently pursued, many instructive replieS‚ and much in-
formation that is truly valuable will be elicited.

And 10 011101 10 encourage the large corps of mariners who are co-operating in this work, I may be
excused sor enumerating some of the most striking of the probable results, which these investigations encourage
us to anticipate, or induce us to inquire for.

lst. These investigations will probably show that the mean temperature of the ocean for any parallel is
higher than that of the air for the same parallel at sea, even though a cold current be present.

2d. They afford room to suppose, and themselves suggest the supposition, that the air which the S. E.
trade winds discharge into the belt of equatorial calme, after ascending there, flows sor the most part over into
the northern hemisphere3 while that which the N. Ε. 11311οε discharge into the same belt, passes in like manner

over into the southern hemisphere.

3d. That the calms of Cancer and of Capricorn 310 ‘caused by the meeting of‘two upper currents; the one
l'rom the Pole being dry, the other from the Equator being charged with vapor.
4th.' That there is a region of calms near the poles in which the barometer on 3 level-with the sea, probably

stands lower than it does generally on the sea level of the earth ; »31111 1110 inquii-y is suggested whether the

magnetic pole be not within this region.

5th. That the trade wind regions are the evaporating regions; and that we ought 10 inquire whether the

electricity displayed in our thunder storms does not come from the trade wind regions 3011 go up into the

clouds with the vapor from the sea.

6111. Τ1131 1110 waters of the Mississippi River and the great American Lakes are rained from cloudS, the
vapor for which was taken up from the South Pacific Ocean, while the waters of the Amazon and Oronoco

are evaporated exclusively from the Atlantic.

7th. That the springs in the ocean which supply the sources of all the great rivers of the northern hemisphere

are, for the most part, to be found where the S. Ε. 113110 winds blow, in the Atlantia, Pacific and Indian oceanS.

8th. That magnetism is probably an agent in giving direction to the circulation of the atmosphere 3 and the

question is raised, if it be not concerned in the currents of the ocean also.
9111. Τ1131 1110 “ red fogs’' of the Cape Verde IslandS, and the so-called “ African dost„ of the North

Atlantic, is dust from the basin of the Amazon and 01011000, taken up by the winds in the dry seasonS, and
transported in the upper current from the equator towards the pole, that is counter to the N. E. trade windS. .
This “ dust„ is known to consist, for the most part, of infusoria, from the river basins of South America, and the
microscopic examinations of Prof. Ehrenberg go far to prove that such is the origin of the “ 1011 fogs and seadust.’'

lOth. That the basin which holds the Gulf of MexicO, is a little ovet 3 mile deep, on the average‘ that
