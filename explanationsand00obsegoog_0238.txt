Sm :—1 have the honor to report that at 10.30 A. M. Ι tried another deep sounding from the quarter3
the ship being hove to, with the air light from the Northward and Eastward and the sea smooth. As you di·
rected 1 had one Paixhan ahot, with its core filled with lead, weighing then, seventy·one poundS, attached to
the line, which sor the first one hundred sathoms was doubled. It was then lowered into the water and the time
marked. The first 1,ooo fathoms run out in 12 minutes—second 1‚000 fathoms in 15 minutes; after veering
145 sathoms more, the line parted. Near the end of the 2,000 sathoms length, the drist becoming large, the
line was gradually ch·ecked by pressing the reel, until it was finally stopped. A taut strain was then obtained,
but the trending of the line was but little changed. Now to ascertain if the shot was lodged, the reel was
. made to revolve rapidly, and the bight at once slacked down in a free scope upon the surface of the water, and
only again became taut as the ship sagged to leeward. The same experiment was again attempted when the
line parted, apparently by the drift stmin, with 2145 sathoms out. The fracture took place about 250 sathoms
from the surface ; thus about 1,9oo sathoms were lost. This line however is of a superior quality and capable
os standing a strain or weight one half greater than the line we have heretofore used. It has been marked and
reeled up since our sounding os April 4th. I am sorry to say that I can report with no greater certainty than
before the depth of this part of the ocean. Ι can again only offer my opinion3 which now is, that our Paixhan
shot lodged in near 1800 fathoms water, which would allow for the drift calculated at about half a mile. I am
therefore still more constrained to believe that our deep sounding of April 4th was altogether fallaciouS, and
that no such vast depth as then recorded, is due to this part os the Atlantic. However great inequalities
doubtless belong to the bed of the ocean, as we see exist upon the land above the sea, and as we are now seventy-

six miles distant (north and east) of our former position, the proof is by no means conclusive.''

“ Sra: 1 have the honor to report the result obtained by the deep sounding taken this morning.

Nine hundred and fifty fathoms were run out and bottom reached with a sair up and down measurement.
One 32 lb. shot used. Time os running, 20 minuteS.

This sounding possesses considerable interest from the fact that it was taken only twenty-seven miles
outside the bank of the La Plata, where ninety fathoms are the deepest given by the chart.

The position of the ship at meridian (time os sounding) being as follows t—Lat. 34Ο 50‘ S. Long. 510
40' W. Distance from Island of Lobos 156 miles. Temp. air 7203 water 700.

Upon rousing in, the line parted about fifty fathoms from the surface.’'
