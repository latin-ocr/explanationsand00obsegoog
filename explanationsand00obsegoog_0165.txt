THE oum ΒΕΔ m THE Ancrxc octar«. 159

The berth in which our vessels were made fast at this place was alongside of the low tongue of an immense
berg, which by accurate measurement, towered up to the' height of 245 feet above the water-level. It was
aground in 96 fathoms water, thus making the whole distance from top to bottom 821 seet3 its diameter at the
water-line Ι estimated at 1‚500 feet. We saw many bergs equally as large as this, and some much larger3

but this was the o'nly one thut we had so good an opportunity os measuring with accuracy.

On the 17th the ice opened a little, and we got underway. Hence till the 27th, with almost incessant
work, by watching every opening we continued to make a few miles each day, the Prince Albert keeping
company with uS. On this day, while running through a narrow lead, the ice closed suddenly. The Advance
was caught in a tight place, and pretty severely nipped. We managed to unship the rudder3 but before it
could be secured, the crushing ice carried it under: we had lines fast to it, however, and aster the action of the
ice ceased, it was extricated without injury. The Rescue and Prince Albert, although near uS, were in better
berths, and escaped the severe nip which the Advance received. We were closely beset in this position, and
utterly unable to move until the 4th of August, when, the ice slacking a little we succeeded in getting hold of
the land-ice, one mile further to the north. The Prince Albert was still in the “pack‚’' a mile or two to the
southward of uS. Mr. Kennedy informed me that it was his intention to abandon this route and return to the
southward as soon as his vessel could be extracted from her present position, in the hope of finding the ice
more practicable in that direction. Some letters and papers that he had brought out for the other English
searching vessels, he· placed on board of us; unfortunately we were never able to deliver them.

We lost sight of the Prince Albert on the 13th. For our own part there was no possibility of moving in
any direction. The berth we had taken up under the impression that it was a good and sase one, proved a

“regular trap ;” for the drist pack not only setin upon uS, but innumerable bergs came drifting along from the

southward, and stopped near our position, forming a perfect wall around us at not more than from 200 to 400
yards distance. Many unsuccessful attempts were made to get out. The winds were light, and all motion in
the ice had apparently ceased. The young ice, ton, began to form rapidly, and was only prevented from ce-
menting permanently together the broken masses around uS, by the frequent undulations occasioned by the

overturning or falling to pieces of theneighboring bergs.

My anxiety daily increased at the prospect of being compelled to spend another winter in a similar, if not
a worse situation than was that of the last.
On the 18th the ice was somewhat looser; we immediately took advantage of it, and managed to find an

opening between two large bergs sufficiently wide to admit the passage of the vesseIS. Outside of the bergS,

we had open water enough to work in.

We stood to the N. W.‚ but the lead closing in the distance, and the ice appearing as unfavorable as ever,
Ι did not deem it prudent to run the risk of their besetment again at this late period of the season. And con-
sidering that, even if successful in crossingrthe pack‚ it would be too ‘late to hope to attain a point on the
route of search as far as we‘had been last year, therefore, in obedience to that clause in my instructions which

sayS, “You are especially enjoined not to spend, if it can be avoided, more than one winter in the Arctic
