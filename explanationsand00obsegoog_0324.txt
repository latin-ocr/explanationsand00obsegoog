of accumulating thern in quantities and proportionS, which would possibly make a characteristic difference be·
tween sea water from the Mediterranean and sea water from the Red sea?

That the waters of remote seas do not permanently attain different degrees of saltness—that sea water
like the air of heaven, come whence it may, is always the same—may of itself be taken as a proof, if no other
evidence could be had, that there is a regular and constant passage, secret and invisible though it be,
of the waters from one oceanic basin to another. At least in the present state of our information upon
this subject, we infer that such is the case3 and that it is owing to the agency of currents in the depths below
and on the surface above, that the waters of one sea are not all brine, of another all fresh, and of another
all ice.

Twice‚ perhaps thrice as much fresh water is discharged by the rivers of Europe, Africa and America,
into the Atlantic, as is discharged by all other rivers into the Pacific. Twice, perhaps thrice as much fresh
water is taken up from the Pacific as from the Atlantic by evaporation. Now, if the waters of these two
oceans were never to intermingle—if the waters of the Pacific never found their way into the Atlantic, and
if the Atlantic were never to send its waters to mingle with those of the Pacific ocean in its own basin, what
would prevent the great water-sheds that are drained into the Atlantic from filling its basin up in the process
of time, with fresh water? What, too, would prevent the Pacific‚ which gives more fresh water to the clouds
than they restore to it again, from becoming first, a sea of brine, then finally a bed of salt?

Studying the habits of nature, so to speak, with regard to the air, and the sea, Ι have learned to conjec-
ture that every drop of water now in the Pacific, has been at some former period in the Atlantie; and this
conjecture, reason teaches me, 1s as plausible as is the supposition that every breath of air now in the northern
hemisphere, has at some time or other, in following its appointed pathS, coursed its round in the general system

of circulation through the channels of the southern hemisphere.

Assuming these principles to be in conformity with the designs of nature, 1 have been induced to search
for a current from the Atlantic ocean into the Pacific.

Taking its existence for granted, therefore, as 1 am disposed to do, it can be readily shown that this cur-
, rent does not have its exodus through the Arctic ocean3 for in that case, the precipitation in that ocean being
greater than the evaporation, the waters of the great rivers of northern Asia, Europe and America, being added
to its own waters, would create 3 stream of immense volume and frightful rapidity through Behring’s straits
into the Pacific. Whereas, so far from this being the case, the reverse occurs.

The current through Behring's straits runs generally from, not into the Pacific. 1 have therefore looked

to the South Atlantic 3—to the space between the two stormy capeS, as the only place in which this ex·Atlantic

current could make its exodus. And if, after all this special and minute investigation ;-if, after the most
accurate and careful, and patient examination that has been made of Log·books here for some evidence of this
current ;—if, after the attention of navigators 1133 been called to it, and they have exhausted all the means
which human ingenuity has devised for detecting and measuring currents at sea, and have failed to discover

one here 3—if, after all this labor and research, it should so turn out when we go there with the water thermome·
