wind region, and should give extra-tropical New Holland a slender supply of rain. But what modificatione

, the monsoons of the Indian ocean may make to this mle, or what effect they may have upon the rains in New

Holland‚ my investigations in that part of the ocean have not been carried far enough for a decision.

Taking up the theory of Ampere with regard to the magnetic polarity induced by ar. electrina] current,
according as it passes through wire coiled with or coiled against the sun, and expanding it in conformity with
the discoveries of Faraday, we perceive a series of facts and principles which, being applied to the circulation
of the atmosphere, make the conclusions to which the charts have led me touching the continual “ whirl„ of
the wind in the Arctic regions against, and in the Antarctic with the hands of a watch, very significant—much
more so than 1 had supposed them to be.

In this view of the subject we see light springing up from various sources, by which the shadows of
approaching confirmation are clearly perceived. One such source of light have we from the university of
Greisswald, in Prussia.

Likening the atmosphere with, its magnetic spirals of oxygen to the coils of a wire, and the poles of the
earth to the ends of the helix used by Professor Von Feilitzsch, we might almost fancy that he was experimenting
expressly with the view of throwing light upon the general course of atmospherical circulation.

‘⁴ 1r,” says he in his letter to Dr. Faraday, ‘⁴ we observe two such neighboring particles near the external
“ South pole, then will the more near repel a South pole with the intensity s ; the more distant will turn to a
“ North pole with the intensity π’, but in such a manner that n'<s. But outwardly these two excited mag-
“ netisms act with the differ-enee of their power s-—n' ; but this is in one case Soutlz polar, consequently of the
“ same kind as the exciting South pole. The contrary will take place near the North pole, so that the disen-
“ gaged magvoetism distributed over the bar becomes south polar on that hals which is turned to the South pole,
“ but qutlz polar σί tlte other '²⁰9⁰ that is turned to tlte North pole. A substance where this'takes place is
“ diamagnetic, it places itself equatorial.

“ When the bar of a magnetic substance is so qualified that the separating action of the molecules on each
‘⁴ other must be taken into consideration, then it cah become so strong that the molecules in the middle of the
“ substance are more strongly magnetic than towards the endS. If we observe once more two such particles
“ near two such particles near the external South pole, the South pole of the nearest will tend to recede by an
“ intensrty ἰ from this external South pole, but the more distant will turn towards it a North pole of the in-
“ tensity n'l but in such a manner that π’ 1<³⁴³ 1. Outwardly the two will act with the intensity ”'{'{ but this
‘⁴ is North polar, therefore of a ,contrary nature to the exciting South pole. The contrary will take place near
“ the pole, so that the disengaged magnetis-m distributae! over the bar becomes North polar on the half that is
“ turned to the Soath. pole, bat Soatlz polar on that hats which is turned towards the North pole. A substance

“ where this takes place is mag-aetio, it places itself axial.’'*
“ Applying the former to the theory of Ampere, I was startled because it has hitherto taught only that

“ currents which are parallel and directed in the same way attract, but if they are parallel and not directed in
