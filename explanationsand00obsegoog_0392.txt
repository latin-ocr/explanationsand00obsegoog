wind came out S. S. W.‚ and she went on fanning to the eastward and to leeward. From this place, it took
her 16 days to reach the Line.
Such cases as these are common z—the errors are generally committed by standing too much towards the

old track.

SometimeS, though rarely‚ vessels [make mistakes by going on the other extreme. I find an example of
this sort in the case of the U. S. ship “ VincenneS,” Commander Hudson, on a voyage from New York to Rio,
in 1849.

She had the “Wind and Current Charts” on board, and claims to have taken them sor her guide. q But
I have not been able to reconcile the course pursued by her with the route recommended.

To enable others to judge for themselves in her case, and to profit by her example, I shall quote her
Abstract Log, which has been copied by Passed Midshipman J. J. Hanson, U. S. Navy‚ from the smooth Log
returned by her to the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography.

1 take this occasion to request the navigators who are co·operating with me, not to use the abbreviations
——as the “ Vincennes’' does—to describe the weather3 nor to give any but compass courses for the wiuds, The
reason of this request ie, that with only two or three exceptione, all who send me their Abstracts give compass
courseS, and describe the weather in the “old fashioned way. Audin dealing with such a vast quantity of

materials‚ these departures from the general practice, always create more or less difficulty, and involve liability

to error.
