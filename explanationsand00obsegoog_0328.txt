As to whether the right whales are to be found in the high northern latitudes in our winter, or in high
southern latitudes in our summer, when the whalemen do not visit such latitudeS, of course the Chart does
not show. Thus, between 500 and 600 N.‚ 1300 and 1550 W., we only know that right whales are abund·-
ant from May to September, inclusive3 we know not as to the other months, because the night and cold there
drive the whalemen from this part of the ocean, and we cannot say anything as to the numbers in which the
fish resort there then. The Charts are, therefore, silent on the subject.

It is the same at the South, in its seasons: that is, when it is winter there the whalemen abandon the
high latitudes, and seek their game in more genial climates.

But seeing the abundance of whales in the Greenland and Arctic seas in our summer season, and seeing
that they have not been sought for in similar latitudes South, I invite the attention of whalemen to the subject
of southern whaling in south summer time.

Below the parallel of 500 S :—-indeed, with here and there an exception, 1 might say, that below the
parallel of 450 S. the Whale Chart is a blank. It is very seldom that vessels go beyond the parallel of 550
S. The indications of the Chart are, that somewhere to the south of the paralleIS, and between the meridians
as given below, whales are probably to be found in considerable numbers, if not in great quantitieS, viz:

Below 400 S. from 250 West to 100 East. A
“ 500 S. “ 450 East “ 600 “ B
“ 450 S. “ 1100 “ .“ 1400 “ C*
“ 500 S. “ 1600 “ “ 1500 West D

In view of all the information before me, 1 would suggest the following as a very inviting route or cruise
for a vessel that finds herself on the Whaling Ground of the South Atlantic in our fall months,

She can cruise in the region A, of the last mentioned table; and from that, but still keeping well down
to the South, pass rapidly on, unless she finds whaleS, to the region B.

A week or two here will satisfy her as to the prospect of whales. She may then enter the region C,
where time might be spent in the search, crossing different paralleIS, and taking care to keep well to the South.

After having cruised and tried sufficiently in region C, the favorite region, the vessel may then “ crack
on'' for region D; and when this region is explored, the season at the South will probably be over.

The N. W. are the prevailing winds of these latitudes, and therefore the programme of the route would
be easy. Ending the search for the right whales at the South, and leaving the region D, for the equatorial

cruising groundS, and entering these between 1750 Ε. and 1500 W. , the route westward, and between 50 8.
and 100 8., will be through good Sperm Whale grounds. These grounds commence between the meridiane
of 1800 and 170²> West, after crossing the parallelos 350 South, for just here, Sperm Whales resort in great

numbers. Continue North between these meridiane till you cross 100 South, for there is good sperm fishing
all the way.

From 1700 Ε. to 1650 W., between the Line and 100 8., is capital sperm ground.
