It is estimated thatthree* times as much water as the Mediterranean receives from its riverS, is evapc
from its sursace. This may be an over-estimate3 but the fact that the evaporation from it is in exe-ess ι
precipitation, is made obvious by the current which the Atlantic sends into it through the Straits of Gib1
and the difference, we may rest assured, whether it be much or little, is carried off to modify climate elsewj
to refresh with showerS, and make fruitsul, some other part of the earth.

The great inland basin of Asia, in which are Aral and the Caspian seaS, is situated on the route wh

this hypothesis I have made these thirsty winds from southeast trade-wind Africa and America to take ς
so scant of vapor are these winds when they arrive in this basin, that they have no moisture to leave bel
just as much as they pour down, they take up again and carry off. The level *of the Caspian sea is as perm:
as that os the whole ocean. ,We know that the volume of water returned by the riverS, the rainS, an⁴
dewS, into ’.113 whole ocean, is exactly equal to the volume which the whole ocean gives back to the atmospl
as sar as our knowledge extendS, the level of each os these two seas is as permanent as that of the great o
itsels. 'Pherefore the volume os water discharged by· rivers, the rains and the dews into these two seas is ex
equal to the volume which these two seas give back as vapor to the atmosphere.

These winds, therefore, do not begin permanently to lay down theirload of moisture, be it great or su}
until they cross the Oural mountainS. On· the steppes of Issam, aster they have supplied the Amazon anc
other great equatorial rivers of the South, we find them first beginning to lay down more moisture than
take up again. Ι 11 the Obi, the Yenesi and the Lena, is to be found the volume which contains the expressior
the load os water which these winds have brought from the southern hemisphere‚ from the Mediterranean ant*
Red sea ; for in these almost hyperborean river basius do we find the first instance in which, throughout the 31
range assigned these windS, they have, after supplying the Amazon, &c., left more water behind them t
they have taken up again and carried off. The low temperatures of Siberian Asia are quite sufficient to ext
from these windS, the remnants of vapor which the cool mountain tops and mighty rivers of the souti:
hemisphere have lest in them.

Here Ι may be permitted to pause, that Ι may call attention to the remarkable coincidence, ι

perfect workings os the great atmospherical machine. This coincidence—may 1 not call it cause and effect ἓ-
