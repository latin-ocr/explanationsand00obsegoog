to whales crossing the line, 1 say with Mr. Eldredge, no! no! no! decidedly. Black whales are sometimes
found as low as 18Ο or 200 from the equator, about the bayS, in looking up places for the delivery of their
young3 but in all my experience I never heard of a whale in the open ocean nearer than 250 of the equator¹of
the black whale specieS. I am therefore fully of the opinion, after crossing the equator twenty-four timess
that black whales never cross the line, in which opinion Ι have all of our Sag Harbor whalemen agreeing

with me.''

 

Walter R. Jones‚ Esq.‚ to Lieut. Maury—New Yorlc, September 20, 1849.

“Your esteemed favor of the 15th is received, and 1 am pleased to find that you are engaged in ascertain-
ing the habits and the different kinds of whales of the different oceanS, in addition to the other scientific and
useful researches and discoveries that you are making3 and it will give me pleasure to aid you if 1 have it in
my power to do so.

The right whales differ very much, as you are well aware, and are very different in appearance and size
in different latitudes. By uniting the observations of seamen, and comparing the dates with the places where
whales are seen at different dates, you will contribute in 'determining the places where they may be expected
to be found at different dates in successive years, and thus facilitate the operations of whalemen in taking them.

Our whaling masters tell me that it is a common occurrence to find the ri'ght whale in great numbers
remaining stationary at their feeding place for a considerable time, when they suddenly start off in a particular
direction, when the whalemen by exerting the greatest skill are only able to keep up with them a short time,
and very soon they disappear entirely.

1 cannot give you much information in relation to the important question you wish to solve as to the
northern cornmunication between Bebring's straits and Greenland sea and Davis’s straits. The whaling in
Davis’ straits and Greenland is now almost exclusively carried on by English whalemen. Indeed '1 do not
know and never did know of but one American ship engaged in the whaling business to Greenland and Davis'
straits ; that ship is the McLellan, commanded successively on her three voyages by Jaclrson, Whipple and

Chappell, and is expected to arrive at New London next month3 the third mate os her on a former voyage has
