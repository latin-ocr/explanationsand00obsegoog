passing the La Plata to go to the eastward of the Falkland Island33 some wishing to avoid running by =La
Agle shoal, others fearing to get jammed on the coast of Patagonia. This should no longer be 311 excuse, sor
the first does not exist, and of the latter there is no danger. 1 have cruised for the above mentioned shoal
several 1111103, taking a good departure from the J asans and from N ew Island iu the Falklands, and crossed to
Cape Virginis and back in the long summer dayS, seeing no signs of it. In 1812, Ι left East Harbor, 8131011
Land, with my consort in company, and steered for the shoal, keeping about eight miles apart, the weather
was clear. 1 kept men at the mast-headS, and saw nothing of it. My observations were to be relied upon 3
for Ι 11311 011 1103111 three chronometers‚ which had been well proved at Cape St. John. Ι kept on for Rio Negro,
Ι 31111 011 my arrival, again tried my chronometerS, and found them correct. 1 am well aware that no such shoal
0111313. I have since then tried to find it with the 3011011101, 11111 without 31100033. The Beagle and ’Adven-
ture, and Captain Sullivan of the Navy, have also hunted for this shoal without finding it.

tion. Ι 11310 spent twenty-two years of my life mostly from South Shetlauds to the river La Plata, and once
1 remained six years without coming north of 41Ο 8., 31111 Ι 03111101 say that Ι ever knew during that time the
wind to blow beavily directly on shore for twelve 1101113. My voyages being principally made for sealing 01
whaling, caused me to keep close into the coast, whereby I had the 11031 opportunities for observing the
weather, 0111101113, 111103, 810. ; 111 fact my voyages depended partly 011 111030, and it stood me in hand to make
mysels acquainted with them.

Ι 11310 always found that the sooner Ι 801 10 1110 11031113111, after crossing the Line, the better. I always

try to make the Peninsula of St. Joseph‘s‚ between New Bay 31111 Ρο11 Valdez. The land is high, steep,

clay cliffs, fiat on top. Then Ι 0111103101 10 keep near enough to see the land until Ι 801 11011 to the South, 30
33 10 pass close by Staten Land 3 by doing this, Ι have smooth water, winds from N. W. to W. N. W., and
pleasant weather3 while another vessel will have the wind from W. N. W., and S. W. off 1110 Falkland 13133113,
31111 on the South side of the Islands the wind will be from S. W. to S. This I have proved by having lest
111011 011 1110 J asans and the BusheneS, (these being the extremes of the Islands, both sealing ground8,) and

requiring them to keep a journal of wind and weather. 1 found the wind to prevail much more from the
, and beyond that

 

S. W. and S. 8. W., about one-third or one-half way between Cape Horn and
distance it drew more to the westward, and even to the northward of West. It was a common thing while
at 31101101 under Diego Ramirez, or sealing on shore, to 300 3 103301 pass in·shore of the Island heading up
two points higher than another vessel off shore of them3 and Ι have often started to go in to anchor, heading
well up for the place Ι wanted to come to at, and found 33 1 drew in·shore, the wind gradually headed me off.
When bound to Shetlands from the Cape, or from 8131011 Land (Shetland is our rendezvous 011 account of
getting wood there to last until our return,) we always find after passing the latitude 600 S.‚ the weather much
· milder, sewer blows, but more sog. The currents 33 11011 33 1110 11111113 310 generally the reverse of what they
