“ In going across the Atlantic, and in looking after the vigias and doubtful dangers to which your attention

will also be called, it will be most convenient for you to take up your position for deep sea-soundings in the

calm regions known as the “horse latitudes,’' which in the month of October will be found between the par·
allels of 240 and 250 N.‚ according to longitude3 you will see the limits of this calm belt sufficiently marked
and developed on series B, of Maury's Wind and Current chart, with copies of which the ‘ Taney’ will be
supplied.

“ A series of accurate barometrical observations in this belt of calms will be of exceeding interest and value.
Itis one of the nodes in the general system of the atmospherical circulation of the earth. Here the winds
from the polar, meet in the upper regions, those from the equatorial calmS‚ and they so nearly balance each
other as to produce almost a perpetual calm. We may then look under this meeting of opposing winds for a⁸n
accumulation of atmosphere, and consequently for an increased barometrical pressure, and from this increase
of pressure accurately determined, may be derived an expression to show the total amount or value of those
physical forces which are exerted to put and keep the trade winds in motion. You will therefore be diligent
with the barometer in those regions, and in all others, taking care, when it is mounted on board‚ to note in the
Ab⁹stract Log its distance from the level of the sea.

“ The ‘ vigias,’ and· dangers of doubtful existence or position which you will look after, are Ashton’s Rock,
about latitude 350 50‘ N.‚ longitude ’710 48’ W„ said to be 8 feet above the water, and to have been seen in
1824. False BermudaS, about latitude 320 37’ Ν., longitude 580 37' W. They are rockS‚ said to be frequently
mistaken for the Bermudas, they are laid down in a part of the ocean but little frequented.

“ You will touch at one of the Canai-ies for water. Without unnecessary delay, you will proceed thence
towards the Cape Verds, examining as you go the position of Mary’s Rock, Bom Felix Shoal, the Bonetta
Rocks, and the reef to the west of them, marked on Maury’s chart as doubtful with regard to position.

“ The route, so far as it has been indicated to you, will take you through the Sargasso sea. You will be
carefiil to try the depth, and the temperatura of the water of that sea, and to note the latitude and longitude of
its edges where you cross it.

“ Besides the regular series of deep-sea soundingS, you are requested to make frequent use of the lead
(deep-sea) in the vicinity of all “ vigias” and “ rocks” that are supposed to lie in your way; for if they exist,
you will probably find shoaler water in their vicinity.

“ Aster completing this service, you will put into Port Praya for water and provisions, Filling up with
these, and allowing your crew and officers a few days to refresh, you will again put to sea3 standing to the
southward, and examining as you go Warley’s Shoal and French ‚Shoal of 17963 the supposed place of both
of which are marked on the charts of Lieut. Maury.
