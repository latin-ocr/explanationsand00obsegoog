directly abead, yet that 8 per cent. of them are “ slant” winds from the eastward, which will prevent a vessel
8 times in 100 from lying S. S. E„ the course prescribed.

After crossing 15ο it will be seen that the navigator will have—if the observations consulted givea fair
average as to the direction of the wind—neither head winds nor “ slants”-—until he gets 50 N. Thence to
the equator he is liable to be headed off to the westward 14.“7 times iu 100. He should therefore in this month
aim, if the winds allow, to keep this part of the route under the lee, so as to cross 50 N. to the east of 310.

By “ slants” 1 mean winds, that though not dead abead, will nevertheless head a ship off her course-
thus, for a vessel that wishes to head E„ a wind at N. N. Ε. οι· Ν. Ε. would be what here is called a slent
wind.

The route for each mouth is computed accoiding to the doctrine of chances; the number of observatione
from which each part of the route is calculated is stated in the last column, “ Total number of observations.’'

It will, therefore, be perceived that some parts of each route are entitled to more weight than others.
Thus the per centage of fair and adverse winds for the first course on the December track is derived from 364
observations‚ whereas that for the fifth course is derived from only 26. All will admit that 364 give a better
average than do only 26 observatione·

1t must be further presumed and admitted that vessels may expect, in following any one of these routes,
sometimes to encounter head winds and calms, and have long passages.

But, taking the average length of passage by these routeS, the data of the charts lead us to the conclusion
that a fair sailer, under good management, will run in December from 31 to 36 days from the Atlantic ports to
the equator; in January from 30 to 35 days: and in February and March from 19 to 27 days, against 41 days
by the old or usual route. ’

Navigators who are disposed to try these routes should have the “ Pilot Charts'’ on board; which ‘⁶ Pilot
Charts„ will be furnished to them on application, either at the National Observatory at Washington3 or to
George Manning, Nc. 142, Pearl-street, New York3 provided the applicant will agree to furnish this office an
abstract of his log according to the form with which he will also be gratuitously supplied, and which form may
be found in another part of these directions.

Vessels from other ports of the United States, besides New York, are recommended to make the best of
their way to the track from New York. They should generally be governed by the winds they happen to meet
as to where they will intercept this track. If vessels from southern ports aim to intercept it to the S. of 330
N„ they will be liable to encounter the calms of the Horse Latitudes.
