the sun in the previous summer, and which, by autumn, had heated up the ocean in our hemisphere, has gone
down. The cauldron of St. Roque, ceasing in activity, has failed in its supplies, and the chambers of warmth
upon the northern sea, having been exhausted of their heated water, which has been expended in the manner
already explained, have contracted their limits. The surface of heated water which, in September, was spread
out over the western balsos the Atlantic, from the equator to the parallel of 400 North, and which raised this
immense area to the temperature of 800, and upwardS, is not to be found in early spring on this side of the
parallel of 80 Ν.

The isotherm of 800 in March, afterr quitting the Caribbean sea, runs along parallel with the South
American coast, towards Cape St. Roque, keeping some 80 or 1Οο from it. Therefore the heat dispensed
over Europe from this cauldron falls off in March. But at this season, the sun comes forth with fresh supplies 3 he
then crosses the line and passes over into the northern hemisphere3 and the charts shew that the process of
heating the water in this great cauldron for the next winter is now about to commence.

In the meantime, so benign is the system of cosmical arrangement8‚ another process of raising the tem·
perature of Europe commenceS. The land is more readily impressed than the sea, by the heat of the solat rays:
at this season then, the summer climate due these transatlantic latitudes is modified by the action of the sun’s
rays directly upon the lanil. The 13ηά receives heat from them, but instead of having the capacity of water for
reserving it, it imparts it straightway to the air, and thus the proper climate, because it is the climate which the
Creator has, sor his own wisc purposeS, allotted to this portion os the earth, is maintained until the marine
cauldron of Cape St. Roque is again heated and brought into the state for supplying the means of maintainin g the
needful temperature in Europe during the absence of the sun in the other hemisphere.

In like manner the Gulf of Guinea forms a cauldron and a furnace, and spreads out over the South Atlan-
tic an air chamber sor heating up in winter, and keeping warm, the extra-tropical regions of South America.
Every traveller has remarked upon the mild climate of Patagonia and the Falkland 'Islands

“ Temperature in high southern latitude8,” says a very close observet who is co·operating with me in col·
lecting materials for the charts‚ “ differs greatly from the temperature in northern. In southern latitudes there
seems to be no extremes ot* heat 3ηά cold as at the North.

“ Newport, R. 1., sor instance, latitude 410 Ν., longitude 710 W.‚ and Rio Negr0, latitude 410 S. , and

longitude 630 W.‚ as a comparison:

“ In the former, cattle have to be stabled and fed during the winter, not being able to get a ¹living in the
fields on account os snow and ice.

“ In the latter, the cattle feed in the fields all the winter, there being plenty of vegetationand no use of hay.

‘⁴ On the Falkland IslandS, (latitude 51-20 S. ,) thousands of bullockzr, sheep, and horseS‚ are running
wild over the country gathering a living all through the winter.” .

We should therefore have, on the eastern side of the South Atlantic, the counterpart of the warm
isotherms which stretch up on the western side of the North.

The water in the equatorial cauldron of Guinea cannot escape North : the shore line will not permit it. It
