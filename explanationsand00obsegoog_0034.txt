Memorandum respecting the record-³ to be lcepc qs the state ofthe weatlzer in British Coloniae.

The captains of ports, hai-bor masterS, and keepers of light-houseS, or where those officers do not eirist‚
some other competent public functionary should be requested to keep journals of the weather, on the principle
of the log-books of ships· A column should be specially reserved for inserting the hig-ht of the barometer.

Under the head of “Remarks‚” should be entered all Meteorological Observations considered worthy
of particular notice.

When a keeper of a journal may hear that a vessel has encountered a storrn‚ he will enter in it any
information on the subject which he can rely on, together with the name of the ship, of her owner, and os the
port to which she may belong.

With the view os tra‘cing the course of stormS, the Trinity Board of London have given directions for the
adoption os, measures to obtain a more accurate record of the state of the weather, than has hitherto been kept
at the light houses of Great Britain and Ireland.

·The keepers of these lights having the opportunity of taking their observationS, by night as well as by
day, great advantage may be derived from employing them in this manner. Officers in charge of colonial
light-houses, should be instructed to keep similar journaIS. In noting the wind’s force, both in the harbor
masters’ journals and in the light-house reportS, it is desirable that the officers should adopt the numbers for
denoting the strength of the wind in use at Greenwich Observatory, and about to be introduced at the light-

houses under the Trinity Board.

In the cases of St. Helena and Ascension‚ it is desirable that more precise information respecting the
“Rollers at those Islands should be obtained.

As the object of Her Majesty's Government, in instituting these inquirieS, ls the advancement of knowledge
or science generally, the Governors os the several British Colonies will consider how far it may be in their
power to obtain useful information bearing on the subject, from countries adjoining to their Government in the
possession os foreign powerS, or how far it may be useful to the study of 'meteorology, to exchange the obser-
vations made within their GovernmentS, for those of other countries in the neighborhood.

If at any time desired, there would be no objection to the publication in the colonial newspapers of extracts

from the journal8.''*

 

Ι have deemed the foregoing necessary to a proper understanding of the question herewith submitted to

the sea—faring, meteorological and scientific communities of the world, and for the information of all others,

upon whose co·operation and assistance, the successful accomplishment of the important objects in view, depends.
