 

AUSTRALIAN ROUTRS, E‘rc. 1111

It will be as well for the navigator who is aiming for a quick passage—and who in these times is not?--to
notice how this great circle from the Line in 300 W. runS. It crosses the parallel os 100 S. in 280 48’ W.;
of 200 in 270 31’ W.; of 300 in 260 03' W.; of 400 in 240 16’ W. 3 and of 500 in 210 50’ West, διο.

This route is also impracticable, for it takes one too far south. But it will serve as a guide to another
which will enable the navigator to take the nearest route that is practicable.

Vessels that are bound south-eastwardly, after crossing the Line in 300 west, can generally, reach without
being pinched by the way, 300 S. between 300 and 350 west. The great circle distance thence to Port Philip
is about 6‚700 mileS. But if a vessel do not go south of 550 S., she cannot accomplish the passage from the
parallel of 300 in the South Atlantic in less than 7,400 mileS. It will be observed that since a vessel cannot
make south-easting in the S. E. tradeS, that vessels crossing the Line in 300, or indeed on any other meridian
will find themselves generally forced a little to the westward of the great circle to Port Philip from the
point of equatorial crossing, be ,that upon what meridiari it may.

The majority of vessels bound around the Cape of Good Hope cross the meridiari of 200 W.‚ between the
parallels of 300 and 350 S. Here they generally airu to make a course a little to the south of east. But the
great circle route to Australia would require them to pass the parallel of '700 S. before crossing this meridian
of 200 W. 'l'herefore the course of the Australian·bound vessel between the parallels of 300 and 350 8.,
so far from being a little to the south of east, is only a little to the·east of south. The two routes go off nearly
at right-angleS, and therefore Australian bound vessels do not care to make so much easting in the trades as
do those vessels that desire either to touch at or double' close around the Cape3 consequently it is no object
with thern to hug the trades as close as the Cape or India bound vessels do.

Here, then, as you clear the belt of S. E. trade windS, there is a fork in the mutes· The vessel bound
to or around the Cape going to the east, but she whose destination is for the gold fields South, should
stand on to the southward, not thinking of hauling up to the eastward until she clears the calms of Capri·
corn, and finds herself well within the region of the trade-like westerly winds of the southern hemisphere.

She may then begin to edge away and to haul up gradually to the eastward, crossing 500 S. in about 100
west, and reaching the parallelos 550 near the meridiari of 200 Ε. Upon this parallel (unless experience
shall prove that she may, without inconvenience as to ice and weatber‚ go still sarther south, and the sarther
south the shorter the distance), she should run along till she crosses the meridian os 1000 east, when she may

begin gradually to edge up for her port, but still keeping to the right of the rhomb-line on her chart that leads

to it.

Hence it will be perceived that Australian bound vessels have nothing to do with the Cape of Good

Hope3 they do not wish to go within scarcely a thousand miles of it.

The best crossing place of 300 south that the SxE. trades will generally allow for the Australian route is

about 320 W.—a few degrees more or leSS.

The great circle from this crossing to Port Philip will give the navigator a very correct idea as to the best

course sor him to pursue after reaching 300 S. at the crossing above mentioned.
