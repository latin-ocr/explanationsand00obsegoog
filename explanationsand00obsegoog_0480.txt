’ in this part of the world, is less and less as you ascend the valley of the Amazon. If it be not so
at the surface os the earth, it is certainly so in the cloud region3 for the trade winds as they blow up that
valley drop down the waters which make the Amazon and its tributarie& F inally, reaching the regions of per·
petual congelation as they pass over the AndeS, they part with all the moisture which that temperature can extract.

Tumbling down the slopes beyond, they receive no fresh supplies of vapor between the mountains and the
Pacific ocean, consequently we have along the coast of Peru a rainless region.

These observatione show clearly enough that as the belt of equatorial calms passes over Para, the mean
height of‘the barometer is less than it is in the extra-tropical latitudes generally, or than it is when the trade
winds prevail at Para.

There is no route on which close attention to the barometer while crossing these calm beltS, will be of
more service to the navigator than on the California route from Panatna.-See that Chapter.

In the calms of Cancer and of Capricorn, there is a descending instead of 'an asc-ending current of air3
therefore the barometer ranges higher, on the average, within those two calm belts than it does anywhere else.
The difference, however, does not exceed the tenth of an inch (0.1.) Close attention to this instrument will
often enable the navigator to decide when he has crossed this belt and got into the region of TradeS, even
before he gets the wind from the trade quarter. He determines this by its fall.

The passage between Australia and California should be made ordinarily in from 40 to 45 days z—the

passage to the East being rather the shorter 3 of course clipper ships will generally bring the passage within 40

days ur lesS. See the remarks about the Farallones in the sailing directions for California froin the United

States, page 433.

Sailiny Directions sor enteriny the Porta of the Society blanda*

As the Society lslands are rapidly increasing in importance, navigators visitingthem will find the follow·
ing sailing directions of sufficient value to justify their insertion here.

For their appearance in this place, mariners are indebted to our Consul, Wm. 1-1. Kelley, Esq., who trans·
mitted them from Tabiti to the State Department. April, 1852.

In the island of 'rahiti there are eleven good harbors, namely, 'l'aunoa, (properly 'l'anone,) Papeete,
Rautirare, Temarauri, Tapueraha, Vaiau, Vaiurua, Vaionifa ,Tefaan06‚ Pueu and Vaitoare ; in addition to these
harborS, which are the p'rincipal oneS, there are the following smaller and inferior oneS, namely, 'l'aapuna,
Maraa, Teahifa, Hotumatuu, 'I'eputa, Havae, Temotoi, Hitiaa, Mahaena, and Papaoa.

Taaone on the N. W. side, (known as Taunum) has both a good entrance and anchorage. Τ he latter is
in 13 fathorns on the east side of the bay ; from this harbor there is a good passage inside the reef to Papeete,
the harbor of Taaone may be known by a peculiar mountain at the head of F antua valley, much resembling

a crown 3 when the crown opens on the eastern side of the valley, you are abre-ast of the passage.
