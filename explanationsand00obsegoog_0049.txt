Thus, suppose that, in the district which the compilet is about to transfer, the variation be 2 points East3
what he has recorded in his working sheet as north winds for instance, are transferred to the Pilot Chart as
N. N. Ε. windS, and so on, correcting every course for variation. If the variation be one point or less, then the
transfer is made without any correction. l

Now with this explanation it will be seen that in the district marked A, (Plate 1‚) there have been ex·
amined the logs of vessels that, giving the direction of the wind for every eight hourS, have altogether spent
days enough to enable me to record the calms and the prevailing direction of the wind sor eight hours, 2,144
times t—of these, 285 were sor the month of August3 and of these 285 observations for August, the wind is re-
ported as prevailing from N. 3 times; from N. N. Ε. 1 ; N. E. 23 E. N. E. 1 ; Ε. 0; Ε. S. E. 1 ; S. Ε. 4;
S. S.E.2; S.24; S. S. W. 45; S. W. 933 W. S.W.24; W.47; W. N.W. 173 N. W. 153 N. N. W.
13 Calms (the little O’s) 5 ; total 285 for this month in this district.

Now the only questions to be asked and answered, as expressive of doubt with regard to these results aret
were these observations made under the usual condition of things? And isso ι are there enough ofthem to afford
a sair average as to the prevailing directions of the winds in that district?

The Log Books are taken at random, examined with care and quotedwith fidelity, and therefore, as the

observations were made by mariners as they chanced to pass to and fro through this or that part os the ocean,
the presumption is a fair one that their records shew fairly. Ι

Are the observations sufficiently numerous to afford the data for a fair average?

The answer in this case depends upon the opinion of him who undertakes to reply3 but to be sure of erring
on the right side, if err I must, I have aimed to get at least, on the average, 100 observations for every month
in every district. This is my aim, but practically I have found it difficult to accomplish it. In some districts
Ι have obtained as many as 1800 observations for a single month 3 whereaS, in another month in a neighboring dis-
trict, I have not been enabled to obtain a single observation3 and such is liable to be the case as long as some parts
of the ocean, as there must be, are frequented more than other partS, or as long as crops come to market at
different periods of the year, and commerce has its seasons of annually recurring activity and repose.

There is then this satisfaction to the practical navigator, when he sees a blank wind-rose on the Pilot
Chart: he wants most to use the parts of the ocean that are the most frequented and are the great highwayS,
while those parts which lie out ¹of the paths of commerce possess so little practica] ‘interest to him, that he does
not care to know which way the wind blows there. The navigator, therefore, stands a very good chance of
getting all he wants from these Charts—it is the philosopher who wishes to trace in “his circuit’² the winds
in the unfrequented parts osche ocean, and for his sake it i's desirable to have records extending over all parts
of the ocean and in all seasons alike. .

But plata 1, incom‘plete as it is, affords much that is interesting to the philosophical navigator 3 though it
has been said in high places that philosophical research and the pursuits of the sailor are incompatible: as
seamen became philosophers they “lose the qualities and habits necessary for command at sea.'' So says one

high in office, but who is no sailor, and therefore, no judge in such a case at least.
