10. Any information 'relating to commerce and navigation.

From some cause or other this call for information passed by unheeded. The only response to it was
made nine years afterwards by Captain Potter. I quote it as a part of the history connected with the Wind
and Current ChartS. It is as follows:

Wumam M. Cuma, Esq.

sinz—According to your request I note the following particulars. On my passage to Japan·sea in
March os 1848, passed over the position of Bishop’s Rock of Hone’s Chart3 20Ο 10' North, 1360 50‘ East.
Does not exist. Saw Douglass Reef, which is dangerous3 Lat. 200 251 North; Long. 1360 25¹ East. Saw
Loo Choo IslandS, passed to westward of them3 which is a good route for Straits of Corea. April 17th,
passed Tsusima Island in Straits of Corea, leaving it on the starboard hand, which is the best passage in to

the sea os J apan ; the Straits of Matsmai being dangerous and difficult on account of strong currents3 several

ships having lost cables and anchora in th1s passage. Cruised in this sea until the 4th of August, when 1

went through Perouse Straits.

Winds in J apan sea variable, but mostly from S. to S. W. Ships bound through Perouse Straits must
give the Island of Kefunkerz or Tee Shee, a good berth, as there is a reef off the N. W. end os the island not
on the chart—distance 5 to 10 miles—on which the ship David Poddoik was totally lost in J uly, 1848.

September lOth,—ran through Boussole Strait. Found the Island of Marekan laid down 30 miles to
westward of its true position 3 have been informed that the most of the Kurile Islands are laid down wrong.

This information is generally known to the whaling fleet, but perhaps may not be known to your department.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
OLIVER POTTER,

This attempt to collect materials for a set of charts having failed, 1 next went to the old Log books of the
Navy, and obtained authority to construct from the materials afforded by them, a set of “wind and current
Charts.’'

Upon examination it was found that many of the seold Logs were wanting, and the number on hand not large.
But though slender the data and meagre the materiaIS‚ it was determined that a beginning should be made. It
was made, but the requisite data and means were wanting. It proved an uphill busineSS, and so we balked.

I then brought the subject to the notice of the men of science of the country, with the view of procuring
their countenance to the work ; and, in papers read on the currents os the sea before the National Institute, and

the Association of⁷ American Geologist and-Naturalists, now the American Association, 1 explained the meagre
