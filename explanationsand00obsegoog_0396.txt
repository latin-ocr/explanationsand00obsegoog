on the 32d day was south of the parallel of Rio. This, though, was in the winter and spring when vessels can
afford to keep to the westward, and it was going further West than 1 should advise.

But suppose a vessel to cross in 320 or 330, and to get the S. E. trades at S. E. By standing on S. S.
W.‚ she keeps herself in a position in which any change of wind is favorable. If it haul to the eastward, she
can lay up and clear the land3 if it haul to the southward, she can go about and make easting, and get along
rapidly by stretches upon long and short legs.

The current so much dreaded off St. Roque is a good deal of a bug-bear. Navigators have been frightened
at this current ever since some transports were cast ashore by it, sometime in the last century. But it should
he borne in mind, that it was quite as much of an undertaking for the clumsy transport-built ships of England
in the last century, to contend against a current osone knot‚ as it is now for one of our first-rate sailing clippei·-
built ships, to contend with one of 4 or 5 knotS.

The Log-book of the “ Celia'’, quoted in the 3d edition of this work, is an example. lt would have been
impossible for that ship to beat against a one-knot current. In the days of this wreck, the passage from England
to India averaged nine months. Warren HastingS, when he went out was 10 months on the way. The pas-
sage is now osten made by our ships in less than 3 months. Theresore the ships of those days might be well
cautioned against currents as dangerouS, which the ships of the present day would scarcely regard.

Now, my investigations show that there is rarely off Cape St. Roque, aud in the sair way from the equator
South, either a sweeping or a horsing current. Indeed many accurate and close observers pass there without
reporting any current at all; and though navigators should always be on the look-out for a current there, and
should always make allowance for one that is to set them on the land3 yet when they do encounter a current
there, they may be assured, that as a general rule, it is neither difficult to overcome nor dangerous on account
of its set.

The schooner “ Anna Sophia,'' J. T. Tuthill, sailed from Greenport, New York, for California, December
24111, 1849. She had the charts on board; claims to have followed them, and had a long passage. Vessels
by following the charts may have a long passage, as they sometimes do over all parts of the ocean. But I am
not disposed to permit navigators to commit blunders, and ascribe the consequences to the chaus·

The “ Anna Sophia'’ was evidently not a smart vessel; she had a passage of 9 months to California inclu-
ding the stoppage at St. Catherine’s of one week.

She crossed the Line in about 310 30', fell to leeward, and was a month in getting clear of St. Roque.

l quote so much of her Abstract as relates to her track between the Line and Cape St. Roque.
