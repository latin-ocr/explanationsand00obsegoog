Good passages are sometimes made in September, but, as a general rule, the most tedious seasons of the
year, are the summer and fall months for passages.

After losing the N. E. tradeS, the navigator may consider himself fortunate in this month if be is not

From capt. Samuel Ver-y, ,In—to Lt‘eut, M. F. Maury. .
Rro DE Jannrno, January 30tk, 1852.

“ 1 herewith forward the abstraot log of the “ Hurricane,” from New York to this port (Rio,) You wilt
perceive that 1 lost my topmasts, and all, about the l7th day out, and that 1 had nothing hut 3 courses, miz·
zen top-sail and spanker for three days after, with calms and faint airs from Ε. 8. Ε., and sor 9 days 1 had no
fore top-sail, jib or top-gallant sails set. Neither did 1 have the wind North of Ε. by N. afterwards. How-
ever, I crossed the Equator in 330 40’ West, 26 days from New York, and have had no trouble in getting hy
St. Roque, not going East of 330 20‘ on the passage. From the Equator to Rro, 1 had the poorest chance Ι
have ever known, not having a day without at least 4 hours calm, till Soutb of 200 8. The abstracts of 'the
remaining passages, I may make in the prosecution os this voyage, 1 shall sorward stom the different ports
upon my arrival.”

 

Genera! Remarks on tlte passage from the United states to Poris beyond ttae Equator!
tt has now [J anuary, 1853,] been about six years sinoel first proposed a new and shorter route hence to the

equator, sor all vessels, whether bound around the Cape os Good Hope, Cape Horu, to Rio, or to any os the
ports of South America- The tracks of all such is the same until Cape St. Roque be cleared.

The W. H. D. C. Wright, (Jackson) of Baltimore, was the first vessel to try the new route. In 24 days

from Hampton Roads, she crossed the Line in 310 W., and had a passage os 13 days thence to Rio. Thi·
was in February, 1848.

In May, she went out again, had 33 days to the Line, which she crossed in 330 41’ W. In 3 days after
she cleared St. Roque, On this passage she was detained 6 days by calms between 80 30‘ and 50 N. But
she had no difficulty, it will be observed, in weathering Cape St. Roque, This trip, it took her 11 days to

clear the equatorial calms, which she found between 90 Ν. and 30 Ν,
