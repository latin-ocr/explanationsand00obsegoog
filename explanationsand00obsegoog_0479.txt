extend, was never less than 730, nor more than 770.29 ; that the climate is one of remarkable uniformity, as
to temperature; that the barometer rarely stands as high as 300, except in J uly and August—the dry season,
when the S. Ε. trades prevail ; that in the rainy seasonS, when the calms prevail, it generally stands lowest3

3ηά that its range or fluctuations are small; that the time of day when it is most likely to rain, is P. M. the

hottest portion of the day, particularly in the rainy season3 and that in J uly and August—the height of the
dry season—-the rains are nearly equally divided between P. M. and night3 that is, that even then, it raises on
the average about as much and as often during the six hours from noon to sunset as it does during the 18,
from sunset till noon next day3 and that during the whole period os observation, the thermometer at sunrise
was never less than 700 nor more than 800 ; at noon, never less than 760, nor more than 9503 and at 8 ⁸P.
Μ., the minimum was 720, the maximum only 890. ’

Of course as all the air which the S. E. and N. E. trades keep in motion is discharged into the belt of
equatorial cahus, that air must escape from this belt first by ascending, and then by flowing off in the upper re·
gions of the atmosphere. As it ascends, the pressure upon it is diminished 3 as the pressure is diminished‚ it
expand33 as it expands it becomes cooler; as it becomes cooler the heat which is required to keep suspended
a portion of the moisture with which it is charged, is abstracted from the vapor; and as the vapor loses its
caloric, it is condensed. It then falls in the shape of rain.

Now in the asternoon at Para, when during the rainy season the heat of the sun is felt in its greatest in-
tensity, this atmosphere becomes still more raritied. It ascendS, on this account, the more rapidly and expands
more freely: it cools faster in the uppei· regionS, and then its vapor is condensed 3ηά comes down in the shape
of water. Δ

Now it is obvious that at each rain upon the land the atmosphere is permanently relieved of a portion of
its load of moisture; that although, after the rain,‘a considerable portion of the moisture which has been de-
posited is evaporated up again; yet there is always a portion which runs off into the rivers or sinks into the
earth to seed the springs, δια, which is not evaporated again before reaching the sea.

For these reasonS, we perceive that the trade windS, as they blow up the great valley of the Amazon,
are gradually depositing their moisture as they go; therefore they become drier and drier. And that in order
that such deposition of moisture and process of drying may go on, the temperature at which condensation takes
place, must be lower and lower all the way up from the mouth of the Amazon to its sources among the Andes,
Thus, for instance, the winds which blow up the valley, arrive at Para loaded with moisture up to the tempera·
ture of 800, we may suppose. In passing Para they are subjected to a temperature, we will also suppose, of 750.
of course, then, all the moisture, which by the abstraction of this 50 of heat would be condensed, is showered
down upon Para as rain. Some of this rain sinks into the earth to seed the springs, and some runs off to fill

the rivers, so that the atmosphere does not take it all up again. Consequently the dew point at places above
Para, is not so high as it is at Para, and to get the same quantity of rain to fall in the interior that falls at Para,
the vapor os the atmosphere must be subjected to a lower degree of temperature than it was at Para.

Thus we have reason for the conjecture that the minimum degree of temperature, even upon the Equator‚
