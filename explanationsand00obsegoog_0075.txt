This air that is returning from the North in the general channels of circulatim, does not ordinarily come
in contact with the surface of the water, but remains in the upper regions isolated from all sources of vapor,

except the upper 01011118, until it descends in 1110 calms of Cancer, and commences 10 blow the 1101108, 08 01 Β,
(Ρ1010 ΙΙ.) Ηο10 11 18 08 1110 dry sponge, taking up and evaporating fresh water frorn the sea with great
avidity. This supposition is strengthened by the circumstance that the saltest part of the ocean is near the
calm belts of Cancer and Capricorn. By the time these winds reach the equatorial calms they are saturated
with moisture 3 thus loaded, they return to refresh the earth with rain, to cover the hills with snow, and to
supply the fountains of our great rivers with water.

By reasoning in this manner, we are led to the conclusion that our rivers are supplied with their waterS,
principally from the trade wind regions—the northern rivers from the southern trades, and the southern rivers
from the northern trade windS.

Taking for our guide such faint glimmerings os light as we can catch from nature, and supposing these
views to be correct, then the saltest portion of the sea should be in the trade wind regionS, where the water
sor all the rivers is evaporated—and there the saltest portions are found.

Dr. Ruscammaom, of the Navy, on his late voyage to India, was kind enough to conduct a series of
observations on the specific gravity of sea water.

In about the parallel of 170 Ν. and S. towards the Polar borders of the trade wind regions—he found
the beaviest water. Though 80 warin, the water here was heavier than the cold water to 'the South os the
Cape of Good Hope.

In summing up the evidence in favor os this view of the general system of atmospherical circulatim, it
remains 10 be shown how it is, if the view be correct, there should be smaller rivers or less rains in the southern
hemisphere.

The winds that are to blow as the N. E. trade windS, returning from the Polar regions where the moisture
has been compressed out os them, remain, as we have seen, dry winds until they cross the calm zone of Cancer,

and are felt on the surface as the N. E. trades. About two-thirds of them only can there blow over the ocean,
the rest blow over the land, over Asia, Africa, and North America, where there is but comparitively a small

portion of evaporating sursace exposed to their action.
The zone os the N. Ε. 1101108 011100118, 00 an average, from about 290 North to 70 North. Now if we

examine the globe, to see how much os this zone is land, and how much water, we shall find, commencing

with China and coming over Asia, the broad part of Africa, and 80 00, 001088 1110 continent of America to the

Pacific, land enough to fill up as nearly as may be, just one-third of it. This land if thrown into one body ,

between these paralleIS, would make a belt equal to 1200 of longitude.

Upon this supposition, then, two-thirds only of the N. E. trade winds are sully charged with moisture, and
only two-thirds os the amount of rain that falls in the northern hemisphere falls in the southern.

This estimate as to the quantity of rain in the two hemisphere8‚ is one which is not capable of verifica-
tion by any more than the rudest approximationS, sor the greater extent of S. E. trades on one side, and of

high mountains on the other, must each os necessity, and independent os other agents, have its effectS.
