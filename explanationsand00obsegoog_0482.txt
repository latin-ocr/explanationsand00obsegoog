and free from shoals; as it can only be entered with a fair wind, it can be seldom used, hut it is a good pas·
sage to go out by as the wind in general is from off the isthmus—the current sets out to the southward.

Tapuaeraha‚ on the West side of Taiarapu‚ has a fine 3ηά large entrance. Course in, N. E. by N. In
entering, keep well on the South side, as from the North side the shoal or spit runs off some distance3 in
general, here there is a heavy rolling sea; after you are inside, you can anchor in any part of the harbor.
There is a good passage inside the rees from this harbor to Tarava0, which is generally taken by ships, more
especially heavy ones. It is, however, rather difficult for large ships-to enter this harbor of Tapuaeraha, as the
wind mostly blows out, and it is not prudent to tack through sear of missing stays, the wind being so haffling
off the mountainS. The best way of entering is to round the reef as close as possible, then luff up, clew all
up, and let go the anchor3 then warp in till you have sufficient room to make sail to work up the harbor. The
current sets from this passage to the southward.

Havae, at Teahup00, on the south side of Taiarapu, has a good entrance, course in, N. by E. ᾖ Ε. ; the
anchorage in the hay is only good in fine weather. For small vessels there is a narrow passage to the west·
ward, close in shore into the next hay, where the anchorage is sase· There is a passage for small vessels iu-
side the reef from Teahupoo to Mataoae.

Vaiau, on the S. S. Ε. part os Taiarapu, has a fine harbor—-course in, North. After entering the reef,
haul up to the N. E„ towards a low point into good anchorage, the current in this passage sets to the S. E.

off the Pari, on the S. E. part of Taiarapu is a dangerous rough place sull of sunken shoaIS, extending

two or three miles off the land, and about four miles along the coast, finishing at the Moto'i, which is to he
known hy two small islandS. There is an inferior possage at the M otoi‘. course in, W. N. W. In going in
or out, haul close round to the North reef to avoid the sunken shoaIS, having the two islands on the starboard
hand in entering, haul round the islands to the northward into anchorage.

Vaiurua, on the eastern partos Taiarapu, has a good harhor, course in, S. W. This harbor fs about
two miles North of the islands at the Motoi.

Vaionisa, on the N. E. part os Taiarapu, has a good entrance, course in, S. W. by S. the anchorago
is extensive. After entering inhauling to the southward, there is a shoal—vessels can pass on either side of
it. There is a passage inside the reef from this harbor to Vaiurua. Vessels can enter and depart by either, as
the winds may allow. There is also a good passage from this harbor close down to Tautira point.

Tautira bay is exposed to the westerly winds, and only to be recommended in fine weather. The best
anchorage is close on the N. E. side under the point; on the S. W. side of the hay is a good harbor called
Tefaad. vessels entering the hay of Tautira should steer to the S. W. and then enter the reef to good an·
chorage; from Tefaa6 vessels can go inside the reef to l’ueu.

Pueu has a good passage, course in S. S. E„ in entering, haul round the West side of the reef‚ and steer

to the westward around the first point, and come to anchor off the village. In leaving Pueu, vessels can go

out or a passage to the westward.
