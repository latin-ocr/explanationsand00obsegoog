By tracing on a chart the equatorial limus ot' the N. E. and S. Ε. trade winds, as herein described, it will
be perceived that there is left between the two systema a wedge·shaped band having its broadest part on the
African side of the Atlantic. The region of the ocean which the Planetary Astronomer would observe this
band or belt to cover, is the region which is occupied by the equatorial calms and the African monsoons that
fall between the systems of N. Ε. and S. E. trade winds. And were the belt which represents these calma
different froin the rest as to color, the imaginat-y astronomer would see it as somewhat of an irregular curve,

not having the northern and southern edges concentric. The concave side of this curved belt is turned to
the Ε. of N., and has its centre near the shores of Greenland.

As before remarked, the newly discovered monsoons of the North Atlantic ocean also come within the
belt of equatorial calms. They give the peculiar wedge-shaped form to the regions between the two systems
of trade winda.

Having completed the physical examination os the equatorial calms and winds, if the supposed observet

from some distant sphere should now turn his telescope towards the poles of our earth, he would observe a

zone of calms bordering the N. Ε. trade winds on the North, and another bordering the S. Ε. trade winds on
the South. These calm zones also would be observed to vibrate up and down with the trade wind zones—
partaking of their motione and following the declination os the sun.

On the polar side os each os these two calm zones there would be a broad band extending up into the
· polar regiona, the prevailing winds within which are the opposites of the trade winds, viz: S. W. in the
northern and N. W. in the southern hemisphere. Ι

The equatorial edge of these calm helts is near the tropics, and their average breadth is 10ο or 120. . On
one side of these belts the winds blow perpetually towards the equator ; on the other, their prevailing direction
is towards the poles. Δ

These belts therefore may also he considered as nodes iu the general system os atmospherical circulation.

The atmosphere which the N. Ε. and S. Ε. trade winda keep in perpetual motion towards the equator
has for its node the equatorial calms. Here it ascends, boils over, divides, and ssows off in the upper
regions of the atmosphere, one part going to the northern, the other to the southern hemisphere, to complete the
“ circuit of the winds,’' and to supply the sources os the trade winds with air.

Arrived near the Tropic of Cancer, the northern current meets, in the upper regions of the atmosphere, the
return current which the prevailing winds of the north temperate zone have carried as a surface current to the

hyperborean regions of the North. These two currents produce another node or calm region, in which the

atmosphere descends, and frorn which it issues both to the North and South, assuming, on one side, the char-

’ aeter of N. E. trades; on the other the character of the S. W. passage winds.

This node has its sellow in the southern hemisphere, where there is a like meeting of upper currents ; only

from one side of the zone of the calms of Capricorn, the wind issues as the S. E. trades; from the other as
the N. W. passage winds of that part of the southern hemisphere, which is extra-tropical. See Plate 11, in

which the two outer lines marked A, B, and so on, are drawn to represent the vertical, and the arrows on the

shaded ground the horizontal, motion of the atmosphere.
