In this mouth (April) the amelioration in the temperature became quite sensible. All hands were kept
at work cutting and sawing the ice from around the vessels, in order to allow them to float once more. With
the Rescue, they succeeded‚ after much labor, in attaining this object3 but around the stern of the Advance,
the ice was so thick that our thirteen-feet saw was too short to pass through it. ⁸ Her bows and side-8, as sar

ast as the gangways, were liberated.

After making some alterations in the Rescue sor the better accommodatiori of her crew‚ fires having been
lighted on board of her for several days previouS, to remove the ice and dampness which had accuinulated
during the winter, both officers and crew were transferred to her on the 24th of April. The stores os this
vessel which had been taken out were restowed, the housing·cloth taken off, and the vessel made in every
respect ready for sea. There was little prospect, however, of our being able to reach this desired element
very soon. The nearest water was a narrow lane more than two miles distant, and to cut through the ice
which intervened would have been next to impossible. Beyond this lane from the mast—head nothing but inter-

minable floes could be seen. It was vthought best to wait in patience and allow nature to work for us 3 she
alone could effectually break up and dissolve the icy chains with which she had bound ue.

In May, the noon-day sun began to have some effect upon the snow which had covered the ice ; the sur-
face os the floes became watery and difficult to walk over3 still, the dissolution was so slowjn comparison
with the mass to be dissolved, that it must have taken us a long period to have become liberated from this
cause alone. More was expected from our southerly (trist, which still continuedsand must soon carry us into
a milder climate and open sea.

On the 19th of May the land about Cape Searle was made out, the first we had seen since passing Cape
Walter Bathurst‚ about the soth of January. A few days later we were off Cape Walsingham, and on the
29th passed out of the Arctic zone.

June 5th‚ a moderate breeze from S. Ε. with pleasant weather3 thermometer up to 400 at nonu, and
altogether quite a warm and melting day. During the morning, a peculiar crackling sound was heard on the
fioe; Ῐ was inclined to impute it to the settling of the snow-drifts‚ as they were acted upon by the sun 3 but
in the asternoon‚ at about five o'clock, the puzzle was solved ver-y lucidly‚ and to the exceeding satisfaction of
all hands. A crack in the floe took place between us and the Rescue, and in a few minutes thereafter the
whole of the immense field in which we had been embedded sor so many months was rent in all directions,
leaving not a piece exceeding 100 yards in diameter. This rupture was not accompanied with any noise.

The Rescue was entirely liberated ; the Advance only partially; the ice in which her after-part was irn-
bedded‚ still adhered to her from the main chains ast, keeping her stern elevated in its unsightly position. The
pack (as it may now be called) became quite loose; and but for our pertinacious friend acting as an immense
drag upon us, we might have made some headway in any desired direction. All our efforts were now turned
to getting 1id of it. With saws, axes, and crow·barS‚ the people went to work with a right good will, and
after hard labor sor 48 hours succeeded. The vessel was again afloat, and she righted. The joy of all hands
vented itself spontaneously in three hearty cheers. The aster part of the salse keel was gone, being carried
