feet, and fall into the sea, dyeing it with the crimson fluid wherever the animal pursues its way. Where a

whale has fairly received its death wound there is but a small chance for escape, as it seldom lives above an

hour or so afterwards, When dead, a hole is cut in the head or tail, through which a rope is rove, and if the
ship is ῐοκ the leeward the boats tow the whale towards her3 but if the ship be to the windward‚ this labor is
saved, as she then runs down within a short distance of the whale, where the fore topsail is hove aback, the
whale is hauled alongside, and a cable of rope or chain put round its tail; preparations are now made for
cutting in the blubber and other oily portions of the whale.

This is a laborious process which, for a large sperm whale‚ requires the principal partos a day tp complete.
The cutting operation is performed from stages suspended over the ship’s side; the cutters being provided
with sharp instruments sor the purpose, called spadeS, these have a razor-like edge of fine steel, and are affixed
to poles of convenient length. To make a beginning, a small hole is cut first in the blubber near the head,
and into this is placed a blubber-book, to which is attached one of the two large tackles employed in hoisting in
the blubber, and by means of the windlass a piece os blubber about six feet in width is thus raised up to the
ship’s side. As this goes alost the whale rolls over and over, the blubber peeling off rapidly as it rolls; and as
the cuts are made not quite circularly round, but in a direction somewhat obliquely towards the tail, the whole
blubber comes off the whale in one continued piece, being stripped off in the spiral way from head to tail.
With the aid of the windlass, this piece of blubber is heaved some thirty feet above the deck, when the lower

block of the tackle meets the upper one, which is suspended from the main mastbead, a second taclde then
relieves the first, having a strap of the block inserted through, and secured to the blubber near the deck3 just
above this block the blubber is cut off ; the piece separated forming what is termed a “blanket piece ;'’ this is
lowered into the “blubBer room,’' which is that portion of the ship between deckS, directly abreast and beneath
the main hatches ; 'another piece goes up to the same height as the first, and is in the same manner cut off 3ηά
lowered into the blubber mom, and so on till all the blubber is taken from the whale‚ five or six of these pieces
commonly taking the whole. The carcass is then abandoned to the ravenous sharks and hungry birds that
surround a ship on these occasions, The carcass sometimes floatS, but most commonly sinks.

While the whale is being rolled the head is cut off 3 and it remains alongside secured by a strong rope till
the blubber is hoisted in.

Small whales’ head are heaved on deck whole, but the immense weight of a large one renders it imprae-
ticable3 it is therefore necessary to divide it. Both tackles are firmly hooked to a portion of the head, denom-
inated the junk, and this when cut off requires the united strength of the whole ship’s crew at the windlass to
heave it high enough to reach the deck, 3 large one weighing at least between five and six tons·

The last and most remarkable portion of the whale remains yet to be hoisted in. This is what whalers
term the “ case ;’' it is a body of fluid head matter that osten amounts to twelve or fourteen barrels, which when

removed from the head, leaves a large tubular cavity that runs longitudinally its whole length. lt is enclosed

by a cartiligenous substance that yields no oil, and this again has an outer covering which is of an intermediate ”

nature between blubber and a singular part os the whale called “whitehorse,'’ which contains no oily matter,
