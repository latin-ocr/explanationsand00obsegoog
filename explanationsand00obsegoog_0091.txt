“ ⁶ ¹* ⁴ At length, after the long drought, the welcome season of the rain arrives3 3ηά then

“ how suddenly is the scene changed Ξ * * * * * ⁴ ⁴! ⁴

“ ⁴ ⁴ ⁴ Hardly has the surface of the Earth received the refreshing moisture, when the pre-
“ viously barren steppe begins to exhale sweet odors, 3ηά to clothe itself with killingias, the many panicules
“ of the paspulum, and a variety of grasseS. The herbaceous mimosas, with renewed sensibility to the in-
“ fluence of light, unfold their drooping, slumbering leaveS, to greet the rising Sun 3 and the early song of
‘⁶ birds, and-the opening blossoms of the water plants, join to salute the morning.” ⁴ ⁴ ⁴ ⁴

The color of the ‘⁴ rain dust,” when collected in parceIS, 3ηά sent to Ehrenberg, is “ brick-re‹l,’' or

“ yellow ochre ;’'—when seen by Humboldt in the air, it was less deeply shaded, and is described by him as
imparting a “ straw color'' to the atmosphere. In the search of spider lines for the diaphragm of my tele-

scopeS, 1 procured the finest 3ηά best threads from a cocoon of a mud·red color; but the threads of this cocoon

33 seen singly in the diaphragm, were of a golden color; there would seem, therefore, no difficulty in recon· '
ciling' the difference between the colors of the rain dust, when viewed in little piles by the microscopist, and
when seen attenuated 3ηά floating in the wind by the great traveler.

'It appearS, therefore, that we here have placed in our hands, a clue, which, attenuated 3ηά gossamer-like

though it at first appears, is nevertheless palpable and strong enough to guide us along the ‘⁶ circuits of the

wind„ into “ the chambers os the South.''

The frequency of the fall of “ rain* dust” between the parallels of 170 3ηά 250 N., and in the vicinity of
the Cape Verd Islands, is remarked upon with emphasis by the author. It is worthy of remark ; because in
connection with the investigations at the Observatory, it is significant.

The latitudinal limits of the northern edge of the N. E. trade winds are variable. In the spring they are
nearest to the equator‚ extending sometimes at this season not fai-ther from the equator than the parallel of
150 N. ’

The breadth of the calms of Cancer is also variable3 so 3130 are their limits. The extreme vibration of
this zone is between the parallels of 170 and 38ο North, according to the season of the year.

According to the Charta, and the hypothesis suggested by them, this is the zone in which the upper currents
of atmosphere that ascended in the equatorial calmS, and flowed off to the northward and eastw ard, descend.
This, therefore, is the zone in which the atmosphere that bears the “ rain-dust'’ or “ African sand,” descende
to the surface; and this, therefore, is the zone, it might be supposed, which would be the most liable to showers
of this “ dust.” This is the zone in which the Cape Verd Islands are situated3 they are in the direction which
theory gives to the upper current of air from the Oronoco and Amazon with its “ rain-dust,'’ and they are in
the region of the most frequent showers of “rainadustss’ all of which are in striking conformity with this
theory 33 to the circulation of the atmosphere.

It is true that in the present state of our information, we cannot tell why this “ rain-dust” should not be
gradually precipitated from this upper current, and descend into the stratum of trade windS, 33 it pasees {¹0¹2

the equator to higher northern latitudeS, and as per Mr. Ewbank’s journal, it sometimes doeS. N eighet ean *κδ
