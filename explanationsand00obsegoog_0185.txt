which patted the first time in two minutes at 250 fath0m8, the second time in three minutes at 300 fathoms,
and the third time in eighteen minutes at 1200 sathoms. These failures occurred in observed latitude 190 12¹
North, and longitude, by chronometer, 760 05’ West, with the temperature of the air 830 and of the water 820.
On the 16th of January, two successful soundings were made,—the former in latitude 220 29’ North, and
longitude 840 351 West, at 3.30 Ρ. Μ., and the latter in latitude 220 32' North, and longitude, by chrono-
meter, 840 32’ West, at 5 P. M. In the former case, the line ran 420 fathoms in five minuteS,—in the latter
’720 fathoms in eight minuteS, with the temperature of the air 820, and of the water 800. Between these
soundings in which bottom was found, two unsuccessful experiments had been made to verify the first, but in
one case, the line parted at 280 fathoms, and in the other case, a squall drove us so rapidly as to render the
cast unreliable. All these experiments were made with a waxed line.
· From the effect upon the line when bottom was assuredly reached in these experimenta, a suspicion has
been thrown upon the soundings made before arriving at St. ThomaS.
Fur-ther experiments 1 shall endeavor to prosecute, and to report as soon as practicable.

Santiago de cuba, February sm, 1851.—-1 beg leave. (to continue) to report the results ofsoundings made

since my communication of the 2011: ult.

The first deep sea sounding was made at noon on the 280) of January, in North latitude 240 05¹ and West
longitude 820 05’. Bottom was found with 470 fathoms os line, running out in about six minutes. The tem·
perature of the air 780, and of the water 800.

The next day, J anuary 29th, two shots were lost in unsuccessful attempts, the line parting in both in-
stanceS, once at280 t’athomS, and once 360 fathomS. At a third trial, bottom was found with 500 fathoms of
line running out in about six minutes and a half. This sounding was taken in North latitude 240 37¹, and
West longitude 7 90 48¹. I was the more gratified with succeeding in this third attempt, because it had been
questioned whether the gradually decreasing velocity of the shot’s descent, would not become equal to the
velocity of the current in the Gulf Stream, and the line be taken out indefinitely at a consequent speed. It can·
not now be questioned that bottom was found, as stated. From the time of these experimenta until our arrival
on the 2d of February at Cape Haytien, a strong wind and heavy sea rendered soundings impracticable.

On the 6th February, at noon, we sounded during a calm off Cape Haytien. The line ran perpendicularly
640 fathoms in 8 minutes and 45 secondS. Our position by bearings was in latitude 190 57’ North, and longi-
tude 720 11’ West. Temperature of the air 820, and of the water the same.

On the 7th of February, being in the Windward Passage, midway between Cuba and st. Domingo, bot-

tom was reached with 840 fathoms of line, running out in ten minutes and two seconds. 1 cannot determine,
however, what allowance to make for drift on this occasion, nor infer with any certainty theactual depth found
at this position. Although in heaving-to for these experimenta„ sail is always reduced to topsails 3 yet the
unavoidable drift during a strong breeze, materially effects our result, and prevents our giving at the boet more
than an approximate estimate. Lieut. Taylor, who conducts these experiment quite enthusiastically, will take
pleasure in using the first opportunity to make an attempt at sounding from a boat, and ascertain the com·

parative result.
