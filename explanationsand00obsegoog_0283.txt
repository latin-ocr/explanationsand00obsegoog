The average passage of all the American vessels that arrived during the year is 1874 dayS, i. e. 73} days
longer than the mean of the 6 shortest passages with the charts on board ; 59} longer than the six shortest
without the chaus—20 days longer than the average of the 8 shortest by English ; 4} days longer than the 8
shortest by French, and 3 days shorter than the mean os the 7 shortest passages by' Dutch vessels.

These charts are highly prized by practical navigatorS‚ and are eagerly sought after by them.

This series as far as published is the work of Lieutenant Whiting‚ Passed Midshipmen Wyman, Gibhon,

Beaumont, Temple and Wooley3 and of Professors Flye and Benedict, all of the Navy.

The stade Wind mart.

The charts of the series, marked letter B, are illustrative of the trade winds and the regions ofcalms
and monsoons contiguous theret0. They are constructed according to a peculiar system of engraved squareS.

This serieS, published only for the Atlantic, shows that the N. E. trade winds occupy a belt or zone ex—
tending in length from East to West across that ocean, having a variahle breadth os from 170 to 350 of lati-
tude. Its average mean breadth is about 2303 and in its extreme range it extends from 30 South to 350 North
according to· the season of the year.

This zone makes two vibrations in a year. It reaches its extreme northern declination usually in Sep—
tember. Then returning and following the Sun, it reaches its southern extreme in March and April. Being
stationary sor two or three months, between 30 and 40 North, it commences to return North, and in the months
os August, September, and October, its other stationary period, it is seldom or never found to the South of
the parallel os 90 Ν. The parallel of 90 Ν. may be taken as the mean limit of the equatorial border of the
zone os N. Ε. Trades.

The S. Ε. trade winds occupy a similar zone in the South Atlantic, with a like vibratory motion. The

mean equatorial limit of this zone instead os being near the parallel of 90 South‚ to correspond with the zone

of the ndrthern hemisphere, is in about 30 North.
It is a remarkable phenomenon‚ discovered in the course of these investigations, that the S. Ε. trade winda

blow with more force than do their congeners of the northern hemisphere. They have force enough to push
the latter with their belt back towards the North, intruding occasionally in the late summer, and in the early
fall months, as sar as the parallel of 90 North. Whereas, out os many thousands of records examined, it does
not appear that the belt os N. Ε. trade winds is ever found to cross the parallel os 30 South.

The .two zones of winds are characterized by a like difference of strength in the Pacific. The S. Ε. trade
winda of the Atlantic ocean have force enough to push their equatorial limits over into the northern hemisphere,
and to maintain them there during the greater part of the year. The reverse is never the cases the N. Ε.

trades have not the force to crowd out the S. E. trades, and to maintain themselves for any month of the year

in the southern hamisphere.
