lt is much to be regretted that 1 have not materials enough to give averages that will afford the means os
a just comparison as to the relative advantages of each crossing in the several monthS.

A proper discussion of the best routes to California for the different seasonS, involves something more
than a knowledge os the best place to cross the Line in the Pacific, and of the best way thence to San Fran·
cisco. We want to know the best way of getting to the Line, as well as the best route from it. We know
quite accurately the best route from the United States to Cape Horn3 and with the view of showing navigators
the best route, on the long run, from Cape Horn to California, 1 have prepared the table below, showing the day
and meridian on which the vessels therein· named crossed the parallel of 500 S.‚ and afterwards the equator.
Also the longitude at which they crossed the parallels of 400 S.‚ 350, 300, and 250, concluding that by the
time they ‘reach this last named parallel, they will be in the regular S. E. trades,

1 have then taken the mean of the best passages sor each month to show the best crossing on the average

for each of the southern parallels named. This table cannot fail to be most acceptable and useful to every cal·

ifornia bound vessel.
