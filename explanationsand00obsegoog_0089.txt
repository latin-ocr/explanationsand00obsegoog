and that the volume of air in these upper currents which flows to the northward is nearly equal to the volume
which flows to the southward with the N. E. trade windS, there can be no doubt.

The “ rain-dust’' has been observed most frequently to fall in spring and autumn 3 that is, the fall has
occurred after the equinoxe8‚ but at intervals from them varying from 30 to 60 days—more or less· To account
for this sort os periodical occurrence os the falls of this dust, Ehrenberg thinks it “ necessary to suppose α duat
cloud to be held constantly swimming in tlte atmosphere by continuom cuv-rents of air, aad lying in the region of
the trade winde, but suffering partiat aad periodical &victibus-’²

Now, any one who will take the trouble to consult the “ Trade Wind Charts’' of the Atlantic Ocean, will
see that at the time of the vernal equinox the equatorial calms are “ raging„ between the parallels of 4ο N.
and 50 S„ and that consequently the places between these parallels are then in their rainy season.

The “ rain-dust,” therefore, it may be inserted, could not well be taken up between these two parallels at
such a season. The earth is then flooded with rain, and there prevails a great calm; and as the air is saturated
with moisture‚ and consequently as there is no—little or no—evaporation going on at such atime and place, it
is difficult to imagine how any of the microscopic organisms osa locality so situated should be taken up in the
atmosphere.

But 11· the examination of these charts be carried a little father, it will be preceived that at the time of the
vernal equinox, the valley of the lower Oronoco is then 1n its dry season ‚-everything is patched up with the
drought, the pools are dry, and the marshes and plains arid wastes. All vegetation has ceased, the great
serpents and reptiles have buried themselves for hibernation3 ·* the hum of insect life ιε hushed3 and the still-
ness os death reigns through the valley.

Under these circumstances, the light breeze, raising dust from lakes that are dried up, and lifting motes
from savannahs that are patched up, will bear them away like clouds in the air.

'l'his is the period of the year when the surface of the earth tn this region, strewed with impalpable and
seather· ·light remains of animal and vegetable organisms, is swept over by whirlwinds, gales‚ and tornadoes of
terrific force3 this is the period for the general atmospheric disturbances which have made characteristic the
equinoxes. Do not these conditione appear sufficient to afford the“ rain· ·”dust sor the spring showers?

At this period of the autumnal equinox‚ another portion of the Amazonian basin is patched with drought,
and liable to 'winds that fill the air with duat, and with the remains of dead animal and vegetable matter3 these
impalpable organisms which each rainy season calls into being, to perish the succeeding season of drought,
are perhaps disti-nded and made even lighter by the gases of decomposition which has been going on in the
period of drought. ·-

May not, therefore, the whirlwinds which accompany the vernal equinox sweep over the liseless plains of
the lower Oronoc0, take up the “ rain-dust” which descends in the Northern hemisphere in April and May;
and may it nothe the atmospherical disturbances which accompany the autumna] equinox that take up the

microseopic organisms from the upper Oronoco and the great Amazonian basin for the showers of October?
