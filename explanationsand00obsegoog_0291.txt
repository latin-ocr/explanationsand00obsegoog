the calms near the equator. This place of meeting in the upper regions of the atmosphere, as already remarked,
takes place in the zone of the calms of Cancer. Here the two currentS, the one from the poleS, the other from
the equator, balant-e each other, produce a calm, or the descending node for the northern hemisphere, with an
increase of barometrie pressure.

,In the southern hemisphere a like process is going on3 only there, the N. W. passage wind would, as it
arrives near the Antarctic calmS, acquire a motion with the Sun, or in the direction of the hands of a watch.

That such is the case, the investigations that are carried on here do not prove, but they, and a process of
reasoning guided by analogy, derived from what they do show, suggest that such is probably the case.

The general course of the circulation of the atmosphere, as partly established and partly suggested by
these researches and other sources of information is: an upper current stom the poleS, as far as the tropical
calms, towards the equator3 thence a ‹lescent and a surface current (N. E. and S. E. trades) to the equatorial
calmS. Here an ascent takes place, through which air is supplied for an upper current each way towards the
poles, as far as the zone of tropical 0311113. Here there is a descent 3 and a continuation towards the polar
regions as a surface current, (S. W. passage winds in the northern, N. W. in the southern hemisphere‚) until
it approaches, in part, the calms of the Arctic and Antarctic regione. Here it commences to whirl about in '

the manner already stated, forming the supposed polar 0311113,111 which it ascends, and so commences its return

towards the equator by reversing the circuit just described. Vide Plate ΙΙ.
The following is a part of the. history connected with these investigatione as to the circuit of the winds ε
Extract from a letter to the Prussian Minister, Boron Von Gerolt, dated, National Observatory, June 20, 1850.
“ Speaking in advance somewhat of my publication, but·leaning, nevertheleSS, upon the indications
already given by the investigations which are in progress at this office with regard to the winds 31111 currente
of the sea, 31111 the phenomena connected therewith, I may remark that certain conclusions have been forced
upon me, with such veri-similitude, that it only remains for Professor Ehrenberg, with his microscope, to

write the final Q. E. D. to them.

For instance, my investigations of the winds at sea, so far as they bear upon the subject, seem to indicate

‘ that the rivers and fresh water of the northern, temperate and frigid zoneS, are, for the most part, evaporated‘

from the South thrrid 3 or, more properly speaking, that they are taken up from the sea by the S. Ε. trade
windS. Such at least is the indication ; and certain facts so tend in their bearings, as to convert this indication
into a conclusion that does not appear altogether forced.

As a general rule, most of the land is in the northern, and most of the water in the southern hemisphere.
But notwithstanding the absence of evaporating surface in the northern hemisphere, most of the precipitation
takes place there, if we regard the waters that are discharged into the ocean by the rivers as an expression of
the excess of the precipitation over the evaporation that takes place in the basins dfained by these rivers· The
basin of the Amazon is in both hemispheres; it is, therefore, common, and should not be counted 33 peculiar
to either. The xRio de la Plata is the only great river then in the southern hemisphere3 whereaS, in the

northern, are al113the rivers, great and small, which give drainage to Europe, Asia, and America.
