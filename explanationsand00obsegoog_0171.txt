Lieut. Walsh, and the officers associated with him, acquitted themselves of the duty thus assigned them,
in a manner creditable in the highest degree to them as well as to the profession to which they belong.

The greatest length of sounding line that ever penetrated the depths of the ocean, gives eclat to this cruise
of the “ Taney,„ for to her officers belongs the 1101101 of having obtained the greatest sounding ever known.

To them credit is also due sor clearing off from the charts of the ocean, the names of various rockS, shoals‚
and dangers which for years had been causing mariners 10 111111 0111 of their way: been hindering navigation‚
interfering with commerce, vexing navigators and discouraging 1110101131113, shippers 31111 owners.

Before his vessel was condemned as unseaworthy, Lieut. Walsh 11311 311 opportunity of examining the
localities assigned to no less than seven of these great commercial 11111111311003. Ηο performed this duty in so
thorough a manner, as completely to establish their non-existence. Upon the saith of his work, l have been
duly authorized to 01330 1110 whole seven from the charts. See the list reported by him: pp. 165-6.

The discovery, also, by Lieut. Walsh of a submarine current, of great velocity3 of water in the depths
of the ocean which when brought to the sursace, relieved of pressure and reduced to the surface temperature,
was foundto be lighter than the surface water ;-and that the depth of the North Atlantic ocean probably
exceeds six miles and a half in the deepest parts, also adorns 1110 1131 of interesting results of this highly ser·-
viceable cruise.

On November 15111, 1849, 111 1311111110 310 591 Ν., longitdde 58Ο 43’ W., Lieut. Walsh with his sounding
wire obtained a castos 5,7oo fathoms = 34,200 feet, or 6.48 1111103, without reaching bottom. This is the

greatest depth ever attained‚ and would show that the greatest depths of the ocean exceed the greatest eleva·-
tions ’of the land by more than 0110 111110 31 least. It is v'e'ry desirable to have this sounding verified.

On the return of the “Taney,'' Lieut. Walsh did me the 1101101· to communicate to me in writing, the
results of his labors during this cruise. Though that letter has been extensively copied in nautieal and scientific
works, and though it has already had a wide circulation, yet inasmuch as it is a part of the history of this un-

dertaking, Ι quote it in place.

 

Lieutenant J. C'. Walsh to Lieutemnt Maury.
Bonnam-own, an J 11113111, August 15111, 1850.
8111,-Ῑ have to add to the “Abstract Log'' of the U. S. Schooner Taney, which has been sent you,
some remarks upon the results of parts of our work there recorded: the explorations in the Atlantic‚ for some
of the many rocks and vigias of doubtful existence—deep soundings with the wire—investigations of currents,
particularly the under 0111101113, &c-
The rocks and mgws searched for, with the positions assigned to them upon the Charts, are as follows:
