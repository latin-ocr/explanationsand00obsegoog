212 rm: wrm) Arm omniumr CHARTS.

P. S.—1 hope to return early in May, the beginning of a favorable season for following up the unexecuted
part os my instructions which refer to the European routeS. In that part os the Atlantic are located most of the
reported rockS, shoals‚ and other dangers which are continued on the latest official charts. It is wonderful

that no maritime nation has heretofore undertaken a systematic search for these reported dangers which

render navigation uneasy, if not unsafe. The credit of conferring this essentia] service upon commerce will
belong to the present administration of naval affairS. Care, however, must be taken to conduct the examina-
tion so thoroughly that when the detailed report is published, with diagramS, all the foreign hydrographical
offices may be satisfied. Nothing could be more unfortunate than a superficial search, should the vigia subse-
quently prove to be the real danger. When the chart is once cleared of vigiaS, a rigid scrutiny should imme·
diately be made into all Subsequent reports of such dangerS. Ι am preparing some suggestions to expose
careleSS‚ incapable, or fraudulent navigatorS, or those advertising for notoriety—-in one or the other
of which causes many of these vigias have their origin. Most of the vigias of the Atlantic are retained on
Maury’s late ChartS, and the new Admiralty Char-ts of June last, and they will continue to be regarded as
real dangerS, until they are proven to be otherwise.

I incline to regard many of the currents reported as the result of bad navigation. Careful astronomical
observations for Lat. and Long.‚ made at A. M. and P. M„ twilight (12 hours apart,) compared with the run by
patent Ing, indicate very little or no current by day, but show some defective steering‚ δια, by night. I use
but one binacle, allow but four persons to steer, and do not rely upon a single observer and computet. Ι made
some experiments in 30 fathoms water on our coast with two whale boatS, one anchored by a kedge, the
other having a suspended kettle, which lead me to suspect, that when there appears to be a current setting to

windward, it is sometimes but the boat and pitch kettle, set to leeward by light airs and sea.
