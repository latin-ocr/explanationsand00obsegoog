Between the northwest coast and the meridian of1300 west, from 300 to 400 Ν., the prevailing direction of

the wind in summer and fall is srom the northward to the westward inclusive3 whereas to the west of 1300, aud

between the same parallelS, the N . E. trades are the prevailing winds of these two seasonS. There is a marked

difference in the direction os the winds on the opposite sides of the meridiari of1300 West in the North Pacific. The
cause of this difference has been completely unmasked by the researches connected with these charts. The agent
which produces ithas its seat in the arid plains of New MexicO, N orthern Tean‚ and the regions around about.
At this season of the year, the prevailing winds in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico are from the southward
and eastward ε i. e. towards that great centre of rarification. At this season of the year t00‚ the prevailing winds in
the Pacific, off the coasts of Central America‚ are from the south ward, and also towards the same centre of heated
plains and ascending columns of air3 and we have seen that off the coasts of California‚ between the parallels of
· 350 and 400 N.,the prevailing winds of this season are from the northward and westward—also towards this great
inland “blow hole.'' In it, is seated a monsoon agent, whose influence is felt sor more than a thousand miles
out to sea, drawing back the N. Ε. trades of the Pacific and converting them into a southwardly monsoon sor
hals the year: deflecting the N. E.trades of the Gulf of MexicO, and converting them into a S. Easterly mon·
soon, during the same season: and so influencing the prevailing S. W. winds off our North West Pacific coast,
that they too, are almost made to blow a N. Westerly monsoon.

Therefore vessels bound to San Franc‘isco, should not, unless forced by adverse wind5‚ go any further

beyond the meridian of 1300 West, than they can help.

Supposing that vessels generally will be able to reach 300 North without crossing the meridiari of 1300
W.—the distance per great circle from Cape Horn to its point of intersection with that parallel is about 6‚000
miles. · .-

{ind supposing moreover‚ that California bound vessels will generally, after doubling Cape Horn, be able
to cross the parallel of 500 South, between the meridians of 800 and 1000 W., their shortest distance in miles
thence to 300 Ν., at its intersection with the meridian of 1300 West, wouldbe to cross 400 South in about
1000 W.; 300 S.‚ in about 1040 ; 2Οο S. in about 10903 the equator in 1170 West3 and 300 N., about 1300
W.; (1260 if you can.) By crossing the Line 100 farther to the East, or 100 further to the West of 1170 the
great circle distance srom Cape Horn to the intersection of 300 N. with 1300 W., will be increased only about
150 miles·

Navigators appear to think that the turning point on a Calisornia voyage, is the place of crossing the
Equator in the Pacific. But the crossing which may give the shortest run thence to Calisornia‚ may not be
the crossing which it is most easy to make srom the United StateS‚ and rt is my wish to give, in these Sailing
DirectionS, the routes which on the average will afford the shortest passages srom the United States to Calisornia.

First‚ therefore, let us see which crossings of the Equator in the Pacific give the shortest runs on the
average thence to San Francisc03 then let us find out which of these crossings it is most easy to reacir from

Cape Horn, and then by comparing the two, we may be able to lay downthe best route from Cape Horn to

California.
