In the discovery of this fact we have the key to the. Calisornia route, from the equator up.

A vessel that crosses the Equator in August or September as far as 1200 0r1250 W., is 301113 1500
miles fron the Continent, and about 2500 miles frdrn the centre of this disturbing agent. Being bound from
the 1110331111),Γ to California, she 1133 1113 belt of N. E. trades to croSS. These winds blow with much more reg-
ularity to the West- of 120Ο 111311 they do at this season in with the coast. Having, therefore, to cros} them
the vessel is enabled 10 110 11 by a course on the average, between N. N. W. and N. W. This course brings
her out of thern as far VVest, it may be, as 1450, about the 1311111113 os San Franciseo. But this is the season
when N. W. and westerly winds most prevail in this part ofthe ocean also.

On account of the atinospherical disturbance situated in the interior of Nort'n America, as before explained,
and in the l‹1titude of San Francisco, or as high up as 400, (for that will be found occasionally not too far for
a vessel in the western route to go) the degrees of longitude are not long, and with sair winds it will not take
many days for her, when near the parallel of 400, 10 11111 down 100 01 150 oflongiturle.

Tlierefore, California bound vessels crossiug the parallel of 500 8., from May to October, should bear to
the vvest, while in the southern hemisphere.

Let the navigator draw on his chart two lines from the parallel of 500 S. to the Equator, viz ε 0113 from
Long. 1000 W., Lat. 500 8., to Long. 1300 W., Lat. 03 the. other from Long. 800 W., Lat. 500 8., 10 Loug.
1150 W., Lat. 03 and if the season of the year be any where between May and October when he is on this
part of the route, let him airu tmkeep between these two lines as in a lane. He will not often be able to get
as far West as 900, before crossiug the parallel of 500 8., 11111 113 should endeavor to cross it as far West—
provided he does not go farther than 1000 W.—as the winds will allow.

During the rest of the year the best passage on the average will be made by letting 1113 111013 easterly of
these t vo lines be the western lirnit3 that 13, 1113 navigator need not care, when doublrng C ipe 110111 between
November and April inclusive, to go much &Vest of the line that Ι have recoinrnended to be drawn from 500
8., 111 Long. 800 W., to the Equator in Long. 1150 W. If one be forced at this 3333011 10 cross 500 8., 33
far WVest as 900, 113 will uot infer, therefore, that he is to be thereby a 10331· of tirne: by no means. What 1
want to irnpress upon those who take these Sailing Directions sor their gaude, is that there is no advantage to

be gained by the sacrifice of a week‚ or a day in the winter and spring, for the sake of crossing the equator or

any other given parallel a degree or· two, or even five degrees more to the eastward or westward of the meri·
dian, recornmended. It. will therefore be understood that 850 13 1101 100 far West to cross the parallel of 500 8.,
even sor the eastern passage, provided winds favor that crossing.

There are no rnonsoous here 111 winter and spring, therefore vessels need not fear to cross the Equator pretty
well to tlre eastward of the summer and sall crossing3 and for this reason: In the winter and spring, the inon-
soons are not raging3 the N. E. trade winds are pretty steady even in the vicinity of the coast, and the course
through them to California is northwesterly. After one has passed through these winds at this season, the
ιι110133 Latitude” calrns of the Pacific are often found troublesome3 therefore, to avoid thern as rnuch as

possible, the Californi abound trader wants to be as near his port as practicable‚ when he loses the N. E. trades
