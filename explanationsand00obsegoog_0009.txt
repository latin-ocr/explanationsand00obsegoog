THE WIND AND CURRENT CHARTS.

The great demand for these charts among seamen, and the interest which they have excited among phi·
losophers, make it proper that Ῑ should give a more detailed account than 1 have yet given as to the origin and
progress of the work, the objects it has in view, and the prospects of success·

This seems to be the more proper because, Ῑ hope, by giving such an account, to impress seafaring men
and others, who have it in their power to facilitate the work, with the importance of the undertaking.

And to show the importance of the undertaking, it may be as well to quote what one of the most profound
of philosophers has said with regard to.the subject-matter in hand:

“ In the present condition of the surface of our planet,” says Baron Humboldt, the most celebrated
traveler of the age, “the area of the solid is to that of the fluid parts as 1 to 24, (according to Rigaud,
as 100 to 270.) The islands form scarcely ἡ of the continental masses, which are so unequally di-
vided that they consist of three times more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere;
the latter being, therefore, pre-eminently oceanic. From 400 South Latitude, to the Antarctic Pole, the Earth
is almost entirely covered with water. The fluid element predominates in like manner between the eastern
shores of the old, and the western shores of the new continent, being only interspersed with some few insular

groups. The learned hydrographer, Fleurieu, has very justly named this vast oceanic. basin which, under the
tropicS, extends over 1450 of longitude, the Great Ocean, in contradistinction to all other seas. The southern

and western hemispheres (reckoning the latter from the meridian of Teneriffe) are, therefore, more rich in

water than any other region of the whole earth.

“ These are the main points involved in the consideration of the relative quantity of land and sea, a relation
which exercises so important an influence on the distn‘bution of temperature, the variation in atmospheric pres·
sure, the direction of the windS, and the quantity of moisture contained in the air, with which the development
of vegetation is so essentially connected. When we consider that nearly three-fourths of the upper surface
of our planet are covered with water, we shall be less surprised at the imperfect condition of meteorology
before the beginning of the present century3 since it is only during the subsequent period that numerous ac·
curate observations on the temperature of the sea at differentlatitudes, and at different seasons, have been made
and numerically compared together) ⁹—Humboldt’ s Cosmos.

‘1 beg you to express to Lieut. Maury, the author of the beautiful Charts of the Winds and CurrentS,
prepared with so much care and prosound learning, my hearty gratitude and esteem. It is a great underta-

king, equally important to the praefical navigator and for the advance of meteorology in general. It has been
