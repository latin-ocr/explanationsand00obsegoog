Tlae besl average mutes to andsto, between Nem York, cape C'lear, and the English annuet.

These routes are calculated from the Pilot Chart also3 and they represent each for its month, the best
track οτι tlte average, which a vessel can make.

The navigator who intends to follow any one of these routes should lay it down on his chart from the table3
and when he gets thrown off of it by the winds and currents as he often will, he should then, instead of
turning out of his way to get back to it, recollect that if a special route were now calculated for him from his
position, it probably would not'touch the projected route at all„ He, therefore, is in a new position, and
must consult his pilot chart as to future courses and route. ln recommending these routes, and in speaking
of them, 1 wish navigators to understand and bear it in mind alwayS, that 1 am speaking from the information
before me, which is sometimes imperfect and often deficient. When full and complete, it may modify present
conclusions ; present conclusionS, therefore, must be regarded only as approximations.

If every vessel, whose log between this and Europe has afforded materials sor the Pilot Chart, had always
taken the most judicious course3 and when she was headed off, if she had in every instance taken that tack
which was really the best, and then if a line had been drawn to represent on the chart the average or mean
track of all those vessels sor January, February, March or April, and the other monthS, then that line would be
represented by the route as given in the tables for that month.

In other words, the vessels that shall pursue the routes here given, will pursue exactly that course which

the experience of all has shown to be the best on the average.
By consulting the Pil'ot Chart, or the column “ Total No. of Observations,” in the table of Routes, it will be

obserx ed that for the months for which the routes are given sor European traderS, 1 have not observations enough
to the North of 450 N„ and West of 450 W„ to enable me to speak of the advantages or disadvantages of making
that part of the ocean a greater thoroughfare than it is. .

Take the route from New York in March for illustration z It will be scen by the table that the course
recommended from longitude 550 to 500, is East, and that the winds are from E. on tlae average 1.9 per cent.
of the time, and that a vessel in steering Ε. there, would be headed off from her course by slant winds from
the northward 28 times, and by slant winds from the southward 15.9 times in the hundred—and that these
proportions are derived from the records of 108 vessels between these meridians in that mouth, or which is

the same by 108 observations there, during the mouth of March of different years.
The South, therefore, is the windward side then and there3 therefore these facts thus presented will leave

the navigator when becomes to be headed off in that part of his route, in no doubt as to which tack to go upon:

with the wind directly ahead or East, he should stand to the southward or to windward, because the probabil-

ities of the wind’s coming out from that quarter are greater than they are that it will come from the northward.

Again, from the meridiari of 350 to 300 W„ the best average course is E. N. Ε.-1.3 per cent. of the winds

are dead abead, and 19 are slant from the northward against 4.3 from the other side. Here then it is shown
from the records of 80 vessels, that the northward is the windward side.

l' have the records of two vessels which were together in this part of the ocean, on their way to Europe ς
