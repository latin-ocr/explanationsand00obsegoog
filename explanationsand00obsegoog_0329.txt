The vessel, therefore, reaching this ground between the meridians of 1700 Ε. 3ηά 1800 W„ may tarry in
it, tending westward as long as she has luck, taking care not to look North of the Line here for whales, for
they are not to be found except as stragglers, or in occasional schools.

After crossing these grounds, which reach westward as far as 1700 Ε., 3ηά East 'to America, she should
carry on without stopping to look for whales until she crosses 200 N., between 1650 W. 3ηά 1750 Ε., which
is again fine Sperm Ground. Aster passing west of 1750 Ε., 3113 will find good Sperm Ground between the
parallels of 2Οο N. and 300 Ν., 33 far as 1400 Ε.

Passing from these grounds, excellent right whale fishing will be found above the parallels of 500 Ν.,
between 1350 W. and 1600 W.; above 450 Ν.,- between 1450 Ε. 3ηά 1700 E; above 350 N., between 1450 E.
and 1550 Ε., 3ηά up through into Behring’s 3113113. There is good fishing upon these last mentioned right whale
grounds from May to September, inclusive 3 1 have not yet found the Log·book of any whaler that has
cruised here at any other season of the year, and therefore my information as to the rest of the year is negative.

But there is reason afforded by the Chart for the opimion, that the right whales of the North Pacific ocean,
seldom come to the South of the parallels named3 3ηά 11131, therefore, as a general mle, they remain some·
*where to the North of the parallel of 350 all the year.

If this indication of the Chart be correct, and 1 see no reason to question it, it appears that this animal
must have supplies of food all the year round, above 350 Ν.

Ι have reason to believe that temperature of the sea has much to do with the whale or the growth of its
food: that the sperni whale delights in warm water, and the right whale in cold 3 and those whalemen who
co·operate with me in collecting materials for the wind and Current Charts, and the Whale Chart belongs to
the 331133, will therefore understand- and appreciate the importance of keeping a daily record as to the tempe-
rature of air and water.

There is another point also to which 1 would call their attention, because by regarding it, it may prove of
value to them, and that point is deep sea scandings.

Itis conjectured that the sperm whale goes to the bottom of the sea for its food. What is the greatest depth

to which it can go for this purpose, and are its places of resort confined to parts of the ocean that come within
those depths?

Now, if owners would provide their shipS, each with a few thousand fathoms of twine, and scraps of old

11011 or lead to serve as sounding weights, Ι 3111 sure that the whalemen from the great degree of philosophical

interest, which many of them manifest with regard to my 13333101133, would, in 0311113, get deep-sea soundings
for me. If the ocean were very deep, and the time could not be spared to haul up the line, it might, the length

out being known by what is left, be cut ; and as the line and siuker would nost but little, the expense to each
ahi p would be but 3 trifle.

1 take this occasion to say—because some of the whalemen have supposed it unnecessary to continue the
abstracte when in sight of land—that it is important to have a complete abstract for every day they are at sea,

that we may know whether they find fish or not, how plentifully, the force and direction of winds and currente,
