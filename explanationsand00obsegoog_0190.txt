“ MEM.-91h.-We lost six shot in attempting to sound to·day, owing to the heavy swell, which caused
the line to snap when the ship rosc abast. We then tried a bar of iron which weighed about twelve poundS,

which descended more rapidly than the shot; but the line sailed and snapped. At length we resorted to a
thirteen pound lead, and got bottom as above. The light weight of the lead caused the line to go out very

slowly towards the last, but Ι have no doubt of the sounding. Ι set the drift at about one mile, from which

you can easily calculate the perpendicular depth. The first day we lost one shot only by the parting os the

line ; the second attempt was entirely successful.
“lOth. Lat. obS. N. 310 54'. Long. D. R. W. 610 15'. Too rough sor sounding.

“ llth. The experiments of to-day have cast a doubt over the former soundingS, and 1 am now uncertain

whether we have ever obtained bottom. This sorenoon we got, as Ι supposed, an excellent cast, and the line
stopped running out at 1,ooo sathoms3 the strain was very great upon the line, when it was pulled upon, but
as the breeze was light, it was some minutes before it parted. I felt confident that we got bottom at the time.
But this asternoon there was as perfect a calm as Ι ever saw3 we thought it would be well to verisy the cast
os the sorenoon, and renewed the soundings3 the line stopped running ont-at 1,500 fathomS, and the ship had
not dristed apparently ten yards 3 the line was up and down. But upon pulling upon it, the line came in
gradually, though very heavily ; indeed, sufficiently so as to cause meto believe that if the ship had had
headway it would have parted. And yet we hauled in some three hundred fathomS, the weight diminishing as
it rose, but with no sudden relies of strain‚ as if the line had snapped. It at once occurred to me that if the
shot had broken the line at that depth, the effect upon the reel would have been the same, and it became doubt·
ful whether we had got bottom in this, or in any other sounding. We have lost elevcn shot to·day 3 once the
line snapped at 300 sathoms, and once at 600 fathomS. Ι ought to say, rather, that the knots made by the
rope-makers slipped. The twine seems to be of unequal strength, and sometimes parts without the slightest

apparent cause3 it may be that the knots have slipped on such occasions, I know that some knots have

slipped, from hauling in the end, and finding it cut square off, whereas a fracture always leaves the strands of
different lengths at the broken end. We have, at last, learned how to start the shot fairly, which is a point os
great importance. Take three parts of the twine, sor about fifteen fathoms, and lower the shot into the water
carefully: hold back the reel (which is fitted with a crank, and stands upon a support,) until it takes the
whole weight of the shot upon the three partS, eight or ten fathoms of which remain upon the reel ; when all
ready, let go the crank, and the shot descends without jerking; it is necessary to have a compressor upon the
edge of the reel, to keep it from revolving too rapidly, as the line is apt to run off and get foul in such cases 3
a piece of old canvas in a man’s hand, is probably the best thing of the sort that can be used. 1 am well
satisfied with our recl, (which was made by Captain Platt's direction at the Boston Navy Yard,) and am also
satisfied of the entire practicability of this mode of sounding, if you can get us good line; by good, Ι mean of
equal strength. I send you a specimen of our twine, which easily bears the shot, but in some cases has parted
with it when there has been no jerk, and no unusual duration os the strain. 1 should think that you might
have good twine made of this size, of fine flax, and carefully knotted, or spun in one length, which would

answer every requirement.
