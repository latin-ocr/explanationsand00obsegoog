This being done, the next step in the process, is to find out the best course sor a vessel bound in any
other diret-tion, to proceed in any given mouth.
'l'o do this, it is necessary to find out that track, which, with the average per centum of increased dis-

tance on account of head winds, and the increase ou account of detour, shall give the shortest distance from

port to port—sor when that is found, it is called the shortest average route. This route, when thus found, is
the route which vessels are recommended iu the Sailing Directions to take sor the several months, to and from
Europe to the Equator, sm.

This is a tedious operation ; sor a satisfactory solution of this problem is not to be attained, without many
triaIS. For instance, after crossing the meridian of 250 W., bound from Liverpool to New York, it is compara·
tively easy, in J uly, as a mere inspection of plate VI shova, to make westiug between the parallels οἷ400 aud 450.
But the head winds, and the detour they cause a vessel to make, when she comes to try it, may involve such
an increase os distance as to make it better to take the chauces by some other route; so that it is uot the
difficulty of getting through oue square aloue that has to be considered at a time, butthe difficulties of getting
through all united.

1t may turn out, aster this tentative process has been repeated again aud again, that when we come to
examine and compare such results, we may find two routes widely differing, yet each requiring nearly the same
distance to be accomplished. ln that case, each, track is traced fron port to port; the per centage of head
winds and detour got at carefully sor each square through which it passeS, aud theu iu the Sailing Directious
the preference is given to that track which is least liable to calms, to adverse currents, and to other collateral
drawbacks‚ perplexities, aud delays 3 and which track also has in its favor the shortest distance, aud the greatest
number os chauces tor sair winds.

The centre figures in each square, plate vl, stand as before marked, sor the whole number of observatious
3ηά the per centum os calms. The next figures which are arranged along the inuer circle, 3ηά the per centum
os head winds for the courses ou which they stand, aud the outer circle os figures express the number of miles
that adverse winds will compel a vessel to turn out of the way, if she attempt to sail 100 miles direct ou the
course ou which these figures stand.

Thus it will be perceived, that no navigator cau reasonably expect that the new routes which 1 recum-⁹
mend, are to give the short passages always, aud in every individua] case. They give the shortest passages ou ⁸
the average, aud thus offer the best chauces for a short passage at all times—that’s all. Those chauces, as the ·
charts shew, may, aud sometimes will, turn up adversely. Thus, a vessel trading to Europe, may be told iu the
Sailing Directious, that her best route iu J uly passes through square ‘D‚ aud that her course through it, is East.
Once in a hundred times, however—and just once iu a hundred ou the average—the pilot chart to which she
is referred for a guide, tells her the wind iu that square comes from the East3 3ηά she may find it, when she
gets there, directly iu her teeth z—she may be the unfortunate hundredth veeseh we cannot tell. All that 1
pretend to tell the navigator in such cases is where he will find the greatest number of chauces iu his favor,
aud what is the best route sor him to pursue. lu like manner, he may be recommendes, uot to attempt to
