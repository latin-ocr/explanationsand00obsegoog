we come ‹lown to the lower temperatures—the isotherm of 600 for example—the reverse takes place. In this

case, the most rapid motion of this isotherm is due to a movement of the waters from the hyperborean regions.

Between the meridiatus of 250 and 300 west, the isotherm of 600 in September, ascends as high as the
parallel of 560. Ῑ11 October, it reaches the parallel of 500 north. In November, it is found between the
parallels of 450 and 470, and by December, it has nearly reached its extreme southern descent between these
meridiane, which it accomplishes in J anuary, standing then near the parallel of 400. It is all the rest of the
year in returning northward to the parallel whence it commenced its flow to the South in September.

Now it will be observed, that this is the season—from September to December—immediately succeeding
that in which the beat of the sun has been playing with‘greatest activity upon the polar ice. Its melted waters
which are thus put in motion in June, J uly, and August, would probably occupy the fall months in reaching the
parallels indicated. ’

These waterS, though cold and rising gradually in tsemperature as they flow south, are probably fresher3
and if 80, probably lighter than the sea water; and therefore it may be, that both the warmer and cooler sys-
tems os these isothermal lines are made to vibrate up and down the ocean by a gentle surface current* in the

season of quick motion3 and in the season of the slow motion, by a gradual process of calorific absorption in
the one case, and by a gradual process of cooling in the other.

We have the same phenomena exhibited by the waters of the Chesapeake Bay during the winter.
At this season of the year, the charts show that water of very low temperature is found projecting out and

over-lapping the usual limits of the Gulf Stream. The outer edge of this cold water, though jagged, is cir·
cular in its shape, having its centre near the mouth of the bay. The waters of the bay being fresher than
those of the sea, may therefore, though colder, be lighter than the warmer waters of the ocean. And thus we
have repeated here,·though on a smaller scale, the phenomenon as to the flow of cold waters from the North,
which force the surface isotherm of 600 from latitude 560 to 400 during three or four months.

We have, in the making of ice and in the melting of it again, examples of this irregularity of outline 011 0
still smaller scale. In the freezing os an ordinary pond, the fascicles of ice shoot out, and represent with their
spires, the jagged edgeS, or the cold and warm streaks alluded tc. They perfectly illustrate in freezing, the
manner in which a gentle current of warm‘ water overflowing a surface of cold water may be supposed to send
out its couriers or advance streams ahead 3 and, in melting, the reverse, or the case of the cold water intrud-
ing upon the warmer.

Changes in the color or depth of the water, and the shape of the bottom, &c., would also cause changes
in the temperature of certain parts of the ocean, by increasing or diminishing the capacities of such parts to
absorb or radiate heat.

From these facts, and in the view which I am induced to take of them, I am lead to infer that the mean

temperature of the atmosphere between the parallels of 560 and 400 North, and over that part of the ocean in
which we have been considering the fluctuations of the isothermal line of 600, 18 at least 600 of Fahrenheit—

and upwards, from Jargugary to August, and that the heat which the waters of the ocean derive stom this source,
