May we not look therefore to find about the North-and South magnetic poles these atmospherical nodes
or calm regionS, which Ι have theoretically pointed out there? In other wordS, are not the magnetic poles
of the earth in those atmospherical nodes, the two standing in the relation of cause and effect, the one to the
other?

And have we not a clue already placed in our hands by which the motion of the circular storms of the
northern hemisphere which are said to travel against, and those of the southern which are said to travel with
the hands of a watch, seems to be connected with the like motion of the wind of each hemisphere in its circuit
about its pole? and will not this clue when followed up lead us into the labyrinths of atmospherical magnetism
for the solution of the mystery?

Indeed so wide for speculation is the field presented by these discoverieS, that we may in some respects
regard this great globe itself with its “caps’' and spiral wires of air, earth and water, as an immense “pile'’
and helix, which being excited by the natural batteries in the sea and atmosphere of the tropicS, excites in turn

its oxygen, and imparts to atmospherical matter the properties of magnetism.
Thus, ,though it be not proved as a mathematical truth, that magnetism is the power which guides the
storm from right to left, and from left to right 3-which conducts the moist and the dry air each in its appointed

paths ;—and which regulates the “wind in his circuits ;''—yet that it is such a power, is rendered so very

probable that the onus is now shifted, and it remains not to prove, but to disprove that such is its agency.

 

Of Glouds and tloe ‘Equatorial cloud-Ram!

During the progress of these investigationS, the attention is frequently arrested by proof of the exquisite
skill which has been displayed in the construction of the atmospherical machinery of the Eartht——in wonder
and admiration, we pause to contemplate its beautiful mechanism-its surprising performance.

Among the many striking features which this system of research presents for contemplation, the imagina-
tion dwells with peculiar delight upon those which are brought out in⁸tracing the offices which are assigned to
the clouds in the terrestrial economy.

One need not go to sea to perceive the grand work which the clouds perform in collecting moisture from
the crystal vaults of the sky, in sprinkling it upon the fields‚ and making the bills glad with sbowers of rain.

Winter and summer, “ the clouds drop fatness upon the Earth.’' This part of their office is obvious to all ;

and Ι do not propose to consider it now.

But the sailor at sea observes phenomena, and witnesses operations in the terrestrial economy which tell
him, that in the beautiful and exquisite adjustments of the grand machiner-y of the atmosphere, the clouds
have other important offices to perform besides those merely of dispensing showerS, of producing the rninS, and
of weaving mantles of snow for the protection of our fields in winter. As important as is this office, the philo-

sophical mariner is reminded that the clouds have other commandments to fulfill, which, though less obviouS,
