confidence in the officers‚ one and all, by whom Ι was surrounded. I knew them to be equa} to any emer-
gency3 but Ι felt under special obligations to the gallant commander of the Rescue, for the efficient aid which
he rendered me. With the kindest consideration, and most cheerful alacrity, he volunteered to perform the
executive duties during the winter, and relieve me from every thing that might tend in the least to retard my
recovery.

During the remainder of December, the ice remained quiet immediately around us, and the breaks were
all strongly cemented by new ice. In our neighborhood‚ however, cracks were daily visible. Our drist to the
eastward averaged nearly six miles per day, so that on the last of the month we were at the entrance of the
sound3 Cape Osborn bearing north from uS.

January‚ 1851. Onpassing out of the sound and opening Baffin's hay to the northward, was seen a dark
horizon, indicating much open water in that direction.

On the, 11th‚ a crack took place between us and the Rescue, passing close under our stern. It opened
and formed alane of water eighty feet wide. In the asternoon the floes began to move3 the lane of water
was closed up, and the edges of the ice coming in contact with much pressure, threatened the demolition of

the narrow space which separated us from the line of fracture; fortunately the floes again separated and as·

sumed a motion by which the Rescue passed from our stern to the port bow, and increased her distance from

us to seven hundred yards, where she came to a stand. Our stores that were on the ice were on the same

side of the crack as the Rescue, 3ηά of course were carried with her.

The following day the ice remained quiet; but soon aster midnight on the 13th, a gale having sprung up
from the westward, it once more got into violent motion ; young ice in the crack near our stern was soon broken
up; the edges of the thick ice came in contact, and a fearful pressure took place, forcing up a line of hum·
mocks which approached within ten feet of our stern. The vessel tumbled and complained a great deal. At
last the flbe broke up around us into many pieces and became detached from the sides of the vessel. This
scene of frightsul commotion lasted till 4 3. m. Every moment I expected the vessel would be crushed or
overwhelmed by the massive ice forced up sar above our hulwarkS. The Rescue, being further removed on
the other side of the crack from the line of crushing, and being firmly embedded in heavy ice, Ι was in hopes
would remain undisturbed ; but this was not the case3 for, on sending to her as soon as it was light enough

to see, the floe was found to be broken away entirely up to her howS, and then formed into such high hum-

mockS, that her bowsprit was broken off, together with her head, and all the light wood·work about it. Had
the action os the ice continued much longer, she must have been destroyed.

We had the missortune to find that sad havoc bad been made among the stores and provisions left on the
ice3 a few barrels were recovered, but a large number were crushed and had disappeared.

On the morning of the l4th, there was again some motion in the floes 3 that on the port side moved off
from the vessel two or three feet, and there became stationary. This left the vessel entirely detached from
the ice round the water-line, and it was expected she would once more resume an upright position. In this,

however, we were disappointed, for she remained with her stern elevated and a considerable list to starboard,
