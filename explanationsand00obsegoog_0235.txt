At 9h. iem. 158. threw over the shot (011032 lb.) The time was now marked with precision by your secre-
tary, Mr. Glover, who kindly volunteered his services.
At 9h. 2810. 158. first 300 fathoms had run out in 3m. 00s.
“ 38 00 next 500 sathom mark run out in 8 45

Thus we had three thousand three hundred fathoms out, and, with the exception of the last mark, the
elapsed time increased 10 0 tolerable ratic. The sixth 500 mark, however, is out os rule, and would seem
like a mistake. But how shall Ι account for its successor, the next, or 7th 500 fathom length, which took
fifty-three minutes to run out? But this is not the worst3 for the very next or eighth 500 fathoms run off in
twenty-eight minutes of time! Thus: P. M. 1211. 0801. 00 ’7111 500 fathom mark ran out in 53.00 10ἰο11108.

During the running of the seventh we stopped two 1011111108, which strictly should he deducted from the
5310. Τ1118 was to allow the line to become vertical. A gentle breeze had sprung up from the northward and
westward, which continued about half an 110111, 0οἀ 1110 swell srom the same direction had increased and be·
come more irregular, which made the boat to wallow uneasily, affecting the free running of the line and giving
increased friction to the reel. But all these do not account sor the time. If the jump from l9m. to 37m. staggered
me, what could l think of the next 53m? Was the 1100 incorrectly marked? Was the shot on the bottom ?
Every fathom had passed through my handS, and I had received 00 800801100 of striking. The line was
checked until it became fairly up and down. May the shot have lodged without concussion upon the side of
’0 steep bank or ridge-like elevation, and gradually rolled itself down, drawing 1110 11110 more slowly, after it?
lt had again become dead calm—the sun poured down his hottest rays—the ship had drifted off about a
mile from the boat: we spread our awning and continued sounding. The next time (already recorded) was
500 fathoms in 28 1111011108. Ηο(1 1110 ball here tumbled off the roqf of the bank?
At 111. 910. 158. 9111 500 fathom mark ran out in 33m. 158.

Here the time is becoming again regularly progressive. The breeze again sprung up—-furled the awning,
finding it gave too much drift to the boat. Held on 10 1110 1100 five minutes to allow the swag of the line to
shorten ε 1110 boat was drawn by it to windward at a rate os about one knot per hour! The line became again
apparently vertical. We stopped also six 1011111108 aster having got out 6,000 1111110108, 1110 boat moving astern
as before. These stoppages should strictly be accounted for in the 11100.
Α1 1110 end of 6,300 sathoms stopped six minutes, and at 62500 stopped fourteen 1011111108. Α1 6,700
