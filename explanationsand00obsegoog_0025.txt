Δ ΌΝΙΥΕΒΒΔῙ, ΒῩΒΤΕΜ OF OBSERVATIONS. 19

in making daily, in all parts of the ocean, as they pursue their voyages to and fro, a series of meteorological

observations.

By an act of CongreSS, authority has been given for all the vessels os the Navy to do the same.

The object of this co·operation is not only to improve, sor the benefit of commerce and navigation, our

ς knowledge with regard to the winds and currents of the sea, but to investigate the laws of atmospherical and

oceanic circulation, 3311 10 advance the science of meteorology generally.

Under this invitation, more than a thousand American merchant vessels are engaged in making and re-
cording their observations according to a prescribed form. At the end of the voyage their journals are regularly
returned to this office.

They constitute the materials from which the “Wind and Current” Charts are constructed. These
Charts, on account of the meteorological information they afford, have led to the developments of new and
shorter tontes across the 3333, and to several other results of interest and value. Ι beg leave to send 3 331 of
them, the explanations which accompany them, δια, sor the inspection of Her Majesty’s Officers-

About five-sevenths of our planet is covered with 113131.

11 will be perceived, therefore, that in studying 1113 303133 of the “ wind in his circuit8,'’ and investi·
gating the laws which govern the general circulation of the atmosphere, we must look to the sea for the mle-—
to the land for the exceptione. Therefore, no general system of meteorological observations can be 303-
sidered complete u'nless it embrace the sea as well as the land.

The value of the researches conducted 31 this office with regard to the meteorology of the sea, would be
greatly enhanced by co-operation from the observatories on the land.

Observers with the requisite instruments for this purpose, are already at the principa] stationS. It is as
convenient for them to observe in, as without, concert; for to observe in concert, 3311 according to a uniform
plan, would be attended neither by an increase of time, labor or expense3 but on the contrary, be a saving
of all. ‘

Hence another reason for suggesting a conference upon the subject of a uniform system of meteorologi-
cal observations on board British and American ships, as well as at British and American posts, stations and
observatorieS. On board of every properly appointed ship of both nationS, all, or nearly all, the observations
which would probably be recommended for this universal system are already made. It is the custom to keep
a log-book on board of every ship, and to enter in that log-book remarks and observations upon the windS, the
weather, and the sea 3 and all that is requisite to impart a new and a greater value to these observationS, is
that they should be made all at the same time, recorded in a stated journal—the “ abstract log’' kept for the
purpose—and then be made available by being returned to the office appointed to receive them.

The atmcsphere envelopes the earth, and all nations are equally interested in the investigations of those

laws by which it is governed. There is Russia, upon whose territories the Sun, except in the long night of

the Polar winter, never 3313, perhaps she, of all nations, has gone to the greatest expense in establishing

meteorological observatories on the land, in collecting and publishing 1333113, Sec.
