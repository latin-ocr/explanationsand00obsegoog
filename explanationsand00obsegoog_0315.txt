Ο. Β. Choppell to W. R. Jon85‚ Esq.—New London‚ October 25271, 1842·

“ Having been requested to furnish a description os the Greenland whale and its habits, Ι comply
with pleasure in furnishing what information my experience in the country will afford.

First then I will state, that there are two kinds of whales in the Greenland seaS‚ the first of which is found
in latitude from 590 to 620 North, and invariahly close to the ice‚ which at different seasons extends farther to
the eastward, sometimes as far as 550 of longitude West3 but as the season advances from March, the ice gets
broken and squander in April and May. The whales seek their food and protection from rough weather
among the ice, and always the beavier ice in preference: towards the land to the westward, and where there

is no icc, they are seldom found and never at rest. The currents here set to the S„ Ε. These whales have a

long crooked head, perfectly smooth, with a very high crown or spout hole; measures not more than 50 to 52
feet in length, having a small ridge or hump near the autres, but not like the sperm whales or hump-back.
When the ice is gone these whales seek the land and go up the ssoe which runs far inland towards the west.
The whales farther North, in latitude 680 near the island of Disc0, have no such hump, hut whose habits are
the same. From Disco Island, the currents are found to set from the westward‚ which clears the ice from the
land on the East side of Davis' straitS, an·d leaves water for the whales in this vicinity.

The current at the same time presses the ice over to the West side, haring the passage of the whales up
Hudson straits in the early part of the season; but after June comes in, the ice becomes more open and the
whales can pass through to the Westland‚ where in general there is a strong land ice, in which if there be no
cracks or helea, they remain a short time in quiet. In the early part of J uly, whales are found to he going to
the westward very quick, up Lancaster sound, and in large numbers, where it is supposed by all men that 1 have
conversed with on the subject, that is they meet no firm ice across the sound, they continue their passage either
through Barrow’s straits down to Hudson hay, or farther to the North and westward through the unexplored
regions. Some seasons they have been found, after going up Lancaster sound and being gone for a while, to
return to the southward. From this we must suppose that the tce was so strong that the whales could migrate
no farther West, and the frost setting in obliged them to seek a passage farther South. When it happens that
they come South they keep the land, and generally at the mouth of some deep iulet seek inland again ; and
finally, when in September, if there is any ice in the straits and any whales, we find them with the ice. We
seldom find whales to the northward of Lancaster sound in Baffin’s hay. But in former years it has been said
they were quite numerous in latitude 760 35¹. Off Pond’s iulet in latitude ’740 North, longitude ‘760 30¹ W. , we
find whales coming from the middle of the straits3 and if the land ice permits, they go directly up the inlet ; if
not, they remain awhile‚ then make up the sound. In March we find the old whales with their young in latitude
600 to 620. In August we find many ‘young ones in latitude 740, yielding from 50 to 60 barrels. The largest
one that 1 have seen taken yielded 175 barrels and 2,200 pounds hone. About whales stopping under the ice,
1 would say that they can at certain seasons stop beneath the water according to their own pleasure, or as

nature, accordingto my own judgment, has created them to lay at bottom dormant for a length of time. ῐ am

strengthened4i8n this belief hy hearing the Governor os Disco relate the fact that he saw a whale lying at the
