My object in entering into this explanation to your Excellency, is respectfully to suggest sor your consid·

eration, whether great benefit might not result if your Government would invite your Consuls and Naval
OfficerS, wherever stationed, to join their efforts to those of British Consulssand OfficerS, in investigating the
laws of the winds, A notice published in India by the Governor General, by desire of the Court os DirectorS,
has led‚to the most important practical results, It is by the combined efforts of American and British, that
the knowledge we now possess of Atlantic storms has become of great practical use in navigation, and the

unlimited extension of similar efforts to other 3333, would, I trust, be os benefit to mankind generally.
