is between a triangle and semi-lunar form, and is the principal organ for impelling the whale along. The two
pectoral fins serve rather⁶to guide than to produce its motion. From the head to the hump, the whale ap·
proaches to a circu lar sorm3 from thence the body t‘erminates in an uneven ridge above andbelow, and dimin-
ishes in size till at the junction of the tail, it is not above 6 feet in circumference; this hinder part of the body
measuring much more vertically than horizontally. The hump is a protuberance on the whale’s back about 2
feet high, and when the whale is swimming along the surface this is seen elevated so' much above it. The
whale has no exter-nal ears, but two small apertures for admissi-aon of sound; the eyes have moveable fids, and
are between three and four inches in diameter.

In comparison with the males, the females are diminutive, a full grown one of the latter not exceeding in
bulk one-fourth os that of the former, and seldom making more than 20 bbls. of eil, osten much less. They
are found in herds together with their cubs, varying in numbers from fifteen or twenty, to above an hundred ;
among them are some scarcely ten feet long. The writer had one of these nursling cubs hoisted on deek whole, .
which ¹measured 14 feet in length, and yielded no more than 20 gallons of oil. ς This afforded an excellent
opportunity of examining the int-emal structure os the whale, and on an occasion like this, the young whaler is
never backwards in doing so, as by observing the position of the seat of life, he is enabled afterward to point
his lance with a more deadly aim. Though it be somewhat perilouS, an enconnter with one of these immense
herds is a whaler's delight‚ since sometimes no less than eight or ten reward the adventurous exertionS. 1t is
a singular fact that when one of these whales is harpooned, though the herd, or shoal‚ as it is commonly called,
be separated some miles apart‚ it is instantly perceived by the whole, and they either rush with great velocity
towards the wounded whale, or decamp and leave it to his fate. If the whales sur-round the wounded one,
they of each boat may select one of them for themselves3 and when they are killed, to prevent their beinglost,
(sor as they are near the specific gravity os the sea, but a small portion of their bodies remain above it‚) a hole
is cut in each whale, and a pole some 15 feet long, with a small flag affixed to its upper ends, is placed verti-
cally therein. This done, the boats may go in pursuit of more, as there is now no danger of their being

lost, and they may be taken alongside the ship at leisure. But it osten happens when a whale is “ struck'’ in
one of these large hands, that the others all seek safety in ssight, and then the whalers must content them·

selves with slimsares.

Either a whale's sense of hearing must be singularly acute, or else its vision is very powersul in a clear
aqueous medium, for by one of these senses it is enabled to ascertain a long way off when another whale is
attacked. Water, it is said, on account of its density‚ has the quality of propagating sound sarther than the
rarity of the air will admit it; though it has only been ascertained that sound can be transmitted far over water,
not through it.

When unmolested, the velocity of whales is not osten more than three miles per hour, though when
alarmed and closely pursued‚ they are capable of swimming at the rate of ten miles per honr, but they ‘never
go long at this pace before it diminishes to four or five. On receiving a wound in the vitals they spout out

amazing quantities of blood, so as to color the ocean for many yards arouad. Instances are common, not·
