December loch, 1851.--on the Gth inst., we sailed from Havana, and for three days we had to struggle
against fresh gales from the northward arid eastward, and a lieavy head sea. Sounding has been impracticable
until to-day. At 8 A. Μ., supposing ourselves to be on the eastern side os the Florida Stream, we got a cast,
which gave us bottom with 380 sathoms line3 Lat 270 04' N. ; Long. 790 44’ W. Time of running, 4 minutes
51 seconds. Temp. air 740 ; temp. water 800. No drist.

The reel contained 12,000 sathoms line at starting. We used one of your soundingleads* instead of a shot.

We then kept off to the westward, the captain having determined to run a line across the stream, which

could have been done in a sew hours under favorable circumstances· The wind soon became very light,
however, and we have been doing little more than drist with the current all day. At 10 A. Μ., we got another
cast, and got bottom with 274 sathoms line3 time os running, 3 minutes 24 seconds; Lat. 270 16' N ., Long. 79⁰

There could not have been a more gratifying coincidence3 but we were greatly disappointed at finding
ourselves on the western side of the channel, as the wind was too light to enable us to get back into the
middle os the stream. Somebody else may have better luck, and you must take the will for the deed, as
regards ourselves.

At 5 Ρ. Μ., sounded again, and got bottom with 440 sathoms line; time of running, 5 minutes 47
