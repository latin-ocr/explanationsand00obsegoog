Routes to and from Europe!

The information contained under this heading relates to the best routes, under canvass, between New
York and Europe.

The best average route, each way, as it regards the winds, independent of currentS, is only indicated.

U pwards of thirty thousand observations on the winds in this part of the ocean alone, have been collated,
compared and discussed for these routes.

The routes now indicated are the results of this mass of materials, and these routes are to be looked upon
as the mean or average track of all the vessels engaged in making the voyages which have afforded these ob·
servations, supposing that each vessel under all circumstances and on every occasion, had made the most

judicious courses.

My information is yet quite meager in many portions of this part of the ocean, and the present routes
should be regarded, not as fixed and final determinations ; they are rather approximatione.

Though they be approximations to those routes which further investigations, based on more ample ma-
terials, may establish as the best routeS, their importance will no doubt be readily appreciated, when it is con-
sidered that the average per centum of calms, head and sair winds, is stated for each district of 50 square
of ocean through which the vessel· is recommended to pass3 and that they· are stated in the tables and

exhibited on the charts in such a manner, that the navigator who pursues these routes and consults the
authorities before him, will be freed from all doubt and perplexity as to which tack to take when the wind
comes out dead ahead.

Upon a right decision in such cases often depends the success of the voyage, as to time.

1 have now before me the Log·books of two vessels, which afford a case in point3 they were bound to
Europe—were together and had accomplished more than half the voyage; the wind came out abead3 one
stood off to the northward on the starboard tack, the other to the southward on the opposite tack3 one was
right and the other wrong, for in consequence, one got into port 10 days before the other.

In such cases, those who pursue these routes with the Pilot Charts on board, would be left in no doubt
as to the tack having the greatest number of chauces in its favor.

Permit me to call attention to a very remarkable part of the ocean through which these traclrs pass. It
is about 450 N. and 500 W. The water here is permanently cold, so cold that the water thermometer is
sometimes found within the distance of a few miles to fall 400 of Fahrenheit, and 1 notice in many Log·books
the remark, “ water, colored.'’ ³

The spot is also remarkable for its fogs and its disturbed atmospherical conditions. If a vessel could be
sent to examine into it, important service might be rendered to navigation, by showing how, when the heavenly
bodies are obscured, the mariner may determine the position of his ship by dipping his thermometer into the

water ; or the examination might lead to other results not less important. It is probably the centre of great

atmospherical disturbances.
