“ Here, then, is a ship under canvaSS, and with the 'winds alone as a propelling power, and with a crew,
too, so short, the captain informs rne, that she was but half manned, accomplishing, in twenty-two days, the
enormous run of six thousand two hundred and forty·five mileS, (one-fourth the distance round the earth,) and
making the daily average of two-hundred and eighty-three statute miles and nine-tenths (2839). During
eleven of these days consecutively, her daily average was three hundred and fifty-four statute miles 3 and
during four day8‚ also, consecutively‚ she averaged as high as three hundred and ninety·eight and three quar·
ter statute miles·

“ From noon os one to the noon of the next day, the greatest distance made was three hundred and sixty-
two knots„ or four hundred and nineteen mileS, and the greatest rate reported by the captain, is eighteen knotS,
or twenty-one statute miles the hour. This is pretty fair railroad speed.

“The greatest distance ever before performed from noon to noon on the ocean, was 374 know, (4331 statute
mileS‚) by the clipper ship “Flying Cloud,” in her celebrated passage of eighty-nine days and twenty-one houm,
to San Francisc0‚ in 1851, and which yet stands unequalled.* 1 say from noan to noan, because from noon to
noon was not, with either of these ships, the exact measure of twenty-four hourS. The “Flying Cloud'' was go·
ing to the northward and westward, and on the day of her great run she made four degrees forty·six minutes
of longitude—which in time, is nineteen minutes four seconds—that is, her noon to noon for that day was
twenty-four hourS, nineteen minute3‚ four secondS. On the other hand, the “Sovereign of the Seas’' was steer-
ing to the eastward, and on the day ofher great run, she made eight degreeS, sortyffour minutes of longitude—

which in time is thirty-four minuteS, fifty-six seconds—that is, her noon to noon for that day, was only twenty·

three honre, twenty-five minuteS, four seconds long. Thus the “Flying Cloud's'' run in twenty-four houm,
nineteen minuteS, four secondS, was 4331 statute miles: and the other, 419 statute miles in twenty-three honus,
twenty-five minuteS‚ four secondS.

“Reducing these runs each to the performance pro rata according to the log, for twenty four hours, we have
for the former ship 4275, against 437.6 by the latter—that is, the best twenty-four consecutive hours run by
the “ Sovereign of the SeaS‚” exceeds the best consecutive twenty-four hours of the “Flying Cloud,'' only

by the one-tenth part qs one mile. These two ships are certainly par nobile—but the great day‘s performance

of each does not prove the “Sovereign of the Seas’² to be a saster ship than the ‘⁴ F lying Cloud.'’

 

θ N orm—Since this was written 1 have received from the owners a copy os the Abstract Log os the ship ‘⁸ N. Β. Palrner,” (Chai-‘les
P. Lom) from N ew York to San Francisco, in 1852, and which abstract, this letter has called forth. Never having seen or heard os it

before, 1 extract as follows :

⁸⁴ May 2511„ 1852. Lat. 370 46’, Long. 610 20¹ W.; distance 220 miles; strong breeze, high head sea.

‘⁸ May aeth. Lat. 360 32', Long. 530 10’; distance 390 miles ; stiff breeze thoughout the day, made 390 miles in 2⁴ hours.'’

Thia ship was eteering to the eastward, but it appears by the above quoted position· on the 25th and 26111, that her distance was 397
—not 390 miles-from noon to noon, which in her case, was 2311„ 27m.,and 20³4 ἴοι· herdifference οἱ· longitude in time consequent upon
this day’s run was 32m. 40⁸. N ow, according to her distance os the previous day, she went at the rate os 5 miles in 32m. ⁴00.. which
according to this abstrart, gives thas ship the enormous distance of 402 nautical miles, or 465 statute mile· and 6 tenth· in 24 hours!

1 t is very desii-able that shipmasters who are co·operating with me should, when they record cuch enormous days’ runs, report a· to
particulam. 1 will be obliged to them, therefore, whenever their run exeeeds 300 miles a day, is they would send me not only a trans·
cript from the Log-alate, of the cour-ses and distances sor that day, but a copy also os the sights both sor Long. and Lat.. by which the
piace of the ship was established sor the day previous, the day of, and the day aster, the great run. ln sending the siglits, they should

not sorgctS to 6state error and rate of Clironometer.
