3 large and important portion of our navigation3 and this, without ever receiving, without ever needing,
legislative encouragement. A computation roughly made, shows that we have now whale ships enough, if
placed in a direct line, equidistant and just in sight of each other, to form a continued fleet, that might reach
more than half way around the globe. The wealth drawn out of the deep and conveyed ΒΥ them annually to
the shores of America is immense. But aside from contributing thus largely towards our national wealth, rio
small degree of honest pride arises from the knowledge that no nation can rival us in this perilous branch of
industry. The English have, it is true, been for many years engaged in it, and with partial succeSS, but the‘
immense amount of bounty paid ΒΥ their government to encourage the establishment of one branch os whaling
alone, shows how reluctantly they have been drawn into it, and fully justifies usin saying, that, in this pursuit
as in others that call forth daring energy, Old England must yield the palm to Neu: England adventurerS.

From the commencement of the whaling career of the English in the northern scas, down to the year,
1786, that government had paid bounty therefor, amounting to εῑΕ21,266,ΟΟΟ-3 fraction or so of the national
debt. To ensure success in their whaling operations in the South 8838, the English as well as their neighbors
across the channel, have not scrupled to secure for their ships„ masters and other chief conductors of whaling
voyages from the young country that first led the way beyond the two sellow capes, in this great marine enter-
prise. So liberal m fact were the inducements held forth, that merchants as well as seamen removed from our
own to their countries, invested their funds, and became actively engaged in this venturesome pursuit. So far
as we know, a detailed description of the manner of capturing, cutting in, and trying out a whale‚ has never
been given 3 the following may, therefore, supply the place of a better one.

It may first be mentioned, that when a whale ship leaves her port, a man is stationed in the top-gallant
crosstrees of each mast to look out for whales, and the mastheads are kept manned from daylight until sunset,
during all weather that admits boats to leave their ship‚ from the time of her leaving home u'ntil her cargo is

completed, or the voyage terminates; the ship’s company standing watch aloft ΒΥ turns os two hours each.
When the spout of a whale is descried, the discoverer immediately makes it known ΒΥ the welcome, and—on
board of a whaler—-the well known exclamation of “ There she blows!'' which is repeated often, as the spout

appears in view3 and though 1t should be so far off as to be but just discernable, yet by its peculiar formation,

as well 38 ΒΥ the number of times and regularity with which it appears, the experienced eye of a practical

whaler can distinguish at once from what species of whale the spout proceeds. If it be a sperm whale‚ and -

not to windward, the ship is instantly headed for it, and all sail made in pursuit. After some few preliminary
‹·bservation8, such as noting time by watch‚ and with a spy·glass tracing the animal’s way through the sea, its
course and rate of going are ascertained, and it now may be calculated for with tolerable precision.

The ship is usually run within a half mile or so of the spot where the whale is expected to appear, when
it rises' to the surface, and by having the courses hauled up, and one of the larger topsails hove back, she
there remains nearly stationary. The boats are now sent off, and are rowed in different directions, so that if

the whale is not going fast, at least one of the boats is nearly sure of being near him when he rises, or should he

chance to 8οὲιέ up a mile from the boats, they can generally reach him before he has his spoutings out3 as
