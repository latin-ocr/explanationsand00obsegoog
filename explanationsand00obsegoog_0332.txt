There is said to be sornewhere along these routes, a rock just awash and not known to any chart. The
doubtful existence of such a danger is always perplexing and harassing to navigators: not knowing its exact
position they have to turn far aside out of the way, to be sure of avoiding it. The rock is small—only a few
feet across—with bold water up to it. And because it is said to be in a part of the ocean that is so much sre-
quented as is this, it is a matter of great importance to the mariner that all doubts as to its existence and lo-
cality should be removed. I have the reports of navigators who have seen it, and who have passed so close
to it that they might have thrown a biscuit upon it. But its position is vaguely described.

1 have received the following “ Notice to Mariners.”

“On the 2d Dec„ (1849,) the ship ‘Marmion,’ Capt. Freeman, from Liverpool, when in Long. 690 29¹ W„ ,

“ Lat. 410 05’ to 410 01', got in between two tide rips, which broke. Capt. F. had been sounding 21 sathoms,
“ and on steering S. by E. to S. by W. found as little as seven fathoms, which of course would be dangerous
“ in blowing weather. ⁰ ⁰ ⁰

G. W. BLUNT.’'

And in addition the following has been published touching the same:
ὁ Narona. Osssavnonv, February loth, 1851.

Siai—captain R. F. Hartshorn of the ship “ Ε. Ζ.,” reports in his “ Abstract Log” kept for this office,
the discovery of a shoal in a much frequented part os the ocean, viz: near Nantucket shoals and directly in the
route hence to Europe.

Extract from his Log from Liverpool to New York, last J uly—

“ N. B.—During the two days, the 20th and 2lst J uly, I was beating between Lat. 410 10' to 410, and
Long. 690 to 690 w ; the sog very thick3 several times I shoaled the water suddenly from 20 fathoms to 8
and 7—-steering S. S. W. to S. by W. 1 am certain there must be a very shoal spot in the neighborhood of
690 30¹, or 690 351, and Lat. 410 to 410 081. 1 had the lead constantly going during the 56 hourS, and the

soundings differed very materially from Blunt's Charts soundings.
“I have sounded a good deal about Nantucket shoals during the last 8 years, and find the depths of water

in the same places have changed more than 1 could have possibly believed ; but it is a positive sact.'’

The place os this shoal is 6 or 8 miles to the southward and eastward of Davis’ Bank‚ discovered by
the Coast Survey in 1846. Itis possible that this may be the shoal reported by Captain Hartshorn3 but
doubt as to the existence of dangers in such a frequented partos the ocean, cannot bc harmlessly tolerated.
1, therefore, would recommend a careful examination of the locality.

Respectfully, ac.

These reports as to danger in this part of the ocean, led to an examination of this locality by the coast
Survey. The result was, thanks to Capt‘s. Freeman and Hartshorn, the discovery of three shoals.—Vide Coast
