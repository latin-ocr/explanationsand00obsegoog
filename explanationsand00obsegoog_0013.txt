referred to, to cease, and the Earth to fail in impressing its own motion on the atmosphere‚ we should have a·
furious hurricane rushing round the globe, at the rate of 1,000 miles an hour,—tornadoes of ten times the speed
of the most violent now known to us, sweeping everything before them. A combination of the two influenceS,
modified by the friction of the Earth, which tends to draw the air after it, gives us the trade winds, which
sweep round the equatorial region os the globe unceasingly, at the speed of from ten to twenty miles an bour,
the aerial current, quitting the polar regions with the comparatively tardy speed, from East to West, imposed
on it by the velocity due to the 70112 parallel, is lest behind the globe, and deflected into an oblique current, as
it advances southward, till, meeting the current from the opposite pole near the equator, the two combine and
form the vast stream known as the trades,—separated in tw0, where the air ascends by the belt osvariable winds
and rains. Impressed with the motion of the air, constantly sweeping its surface in one directim, and obeying
the same laws os motion, the great sea itself would be excited into currents similar to those of the air, were it
not walled in by continents, and subjected to other control. As it is, there are constant currents flowing from
the torrid towards the frigid zone, to supply the vast mass of vapor there drained off ; while other whirlpools
and currents, such as the gigantic Gulf Stream, come to perform their part in the same stupendous drama.
The current just named, sweeps from the Cape of Good Hope, across the South Atlantic, to the Gulf of Mexico,
and by the Straits of the Baharnas. Here it turns to the eastward again, travelling along the coast of Ameriea
at the rate of from forty to a hundred miles a day ; it now stands once more across the Atlantic, and divides
itself into two branches ;—one finds its way into the norther'n sea, warming the adjoining waters as it ad-
vances, and turning back, most likely to form a second great whirlpool, re-joining the original stream near
Newfoundland. The main branch seeks the northern shores of Europe, and, sweeping along the coast of
Spain and Portugal, travels southward by the Azores to rejoin the main whirlpool. The waters of this vast
Ocean river, are to the North of the tropic greatly warmer than those around3 the climate of every country it
approaches is improved by it, and the Laplander is enabled by its means to live, and cultivate his barley, in a
latitude which everywhere else, throughout the world is condemned to perpetual sterility. But there are other
laws which the great sea obeys, which peculiarly adapt it as the vehicle of interchange of heat and cold
betwixt those regions where either exists in excess. Water which contracta regularly from the boiling point
‘ downwards, at a temperature of 400, has reached its maximum of density, and thence begins to grow lighter
and expand. But for this most benehcent provision, the vast recesses of the northern ocean would be con·
tinually occupied with a fluid at the freezing point, which the least access of cold would convert into one solid
mass of ice. The non-conducting power of water, which at present acts so valuable a part in the general
economy, so far from being a blessing would be a curse. No warmth could ever penetrate to thaw the founda-
tions of the frozen masses--no water find its way to float it from its foundations, so that, like the everlasting hills
themselves, rooted immovable in its place, every year adding to its mass ; the solid structure would continually
advance to the southward, hermetically sealing the polar ocean thus condemned to utter desolation‚ and en·
croaching on the North sea itself. Under existing circumstances, so soon as water is cooled down to 400, it
