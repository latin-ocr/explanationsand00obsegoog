If we add to the effectos this supposed surface current, the drist of the vessel also, we shall be ready to

appreciate the effect of this motion upon the reel, and the rate at which the twine runs off from it.

Now, if we imagine the shot to have reached the bottom, then the effect would be what those who have
attempted these experiments have all witnessed, viz: a continual paying out of the line, and finally a break.

Imagine the effects os an under-current, running no faster even than half a mile an honr, but operating
upon the bight of a line some 3‚000 fathoms long. The leverage in such acase is immense3 it is that so well

known to sailors as “swigging off ;'’ and the strain in such a case would be sufficient to part very strong lines.

Hence the value of the check, derived from carefully timing the rate of descent through various depths at
every cast ;--an‹l of all vessels using the same sized shot for weightS, and twine of the same texture, manu·
facture and kind for the sounding line.

A faithful record of this sort from our men-of-war as they cruise in various parts of the world, will enable
us to determine with a degree of probability, not to be easily weakened‚ as to the relative volocity of the
under-currents in different seas, and in various parts of the same sea.

Returning now to a little further consideration of the table of soundingS, p. 206, we perceive by running
the eye up and down the columns—“Time‚'' “ Fathom8,'’ and “Bate''—that in those soundings w1th
waxed lineS‚ (w,) of near 7 minutes each, the rate of descent is 80, 86, 88 fathomS, respectively. The 80
fathoms rate being in the Gulf stream, and being the only one exposed to so rapid a current.

The sea here is, therefore, probably not quite as deep as this sounding would represent it.

The April soundings are from West to East‚ nearly across the Gulf of Mexico. They appear to be

sufficiently accurate to authorize the opinion which has been already expressed‚ viz: that the basin of the

Gulf in the deepest parts is a little over one mile (880 fathoms) in depth. The very deepest part has not yet
been probably reached.

The western half of the Caribbean basin is probably not so deep, but its eastern half may be deeper.

.. Could we obtain with every sounding in these two basim, specimens of the bottom, we might expect to

gain light from them and this plan of sounding together, which would enable us to comprehend much more
clearly than we now do the system of aqueous circulation of these two basins3 we should discover where

they are silting up; and with the aid of a microscope, we should probably recognise in one place, deposits
brought from the grand South American, and in another, deposites brought from the ‘great North American
system of river basius.

The mariner might then hail the geologist and say, “come and see. Here the Amazon and the Orinoco
are secretly at work in the recesses of the sea ; here, the turbulent Mississippi—and here sub-marine currents
are busy in laying the foundationS, on a grand scale, of sedimentary formatione, which at the next chime of the
geological clock are to rise up from the ocean, to bewilder and amaze Geologists w1th the variety, the extent
and the richness of their organic remains: fossil palms and infusoria from the Amazon3 reptiles from the
Orinoc03 birds from the Rio Grande3 plants and creepers from the Upper Missouri; pine, beach, and ash

from the Mississippi 3—heaped up with wrecks of steamers and skeletons of man and beast, will all in the
remote future be found imbedded together in the same deposit.'’
