Aim to make a straight course from d to d.

Captain Oliver Eldridge os the Liverpool packet ship, the “ Garrick,''—-to whom 1 am indebted for
much valuable information, and who is moreover a most zealous and efficient co-operator in collecting materials
for these charta—reports on his last voyage from Liverpool‚ two deep-sea soundings. They were without bottom,
but they are the first 1 have received from a merchant ship3 and 1 quote them as well sor their value as for the ex·
ample which they afford to the industrious and intelligent navigator, as to what he may dp in assisting men os
science to solve this interesting problem‚ as to the depths os the sea. A line of deep-sea soundings hence to
Europe would be of great value and interest. Itis supposed that the depth os the sea in that quarter is not very
great, and that therefore these soundings may be had without much trouble to those who may be disposed to
undertake them.

The following is from the abstract log of the “ Garrick,’' on her voyage from Liverpool to New York, May
and June, 1852.

“ 30th May, Lat. 480 5’ N ., Long. 410 39' W. ; temperature 5503 Let 1,15o fathoms line run out without
finding bottom.

2d June, Lat. 450 14’ Ν., Long. 460 36' W.; temperature 480. No soundings with 450 fathoms line,
and a strong current setting S. Ε. by E.’'

His distance per log was 3,385 mileS, being only 86 miles more than according to the above route for
May, he should have logged. This is but one of the many instances that 1 continually receive illustrative
of the correctness of the tontes recommended. Steer such courseS, the tables say, you will meet on the
average such and such winds; and the distance which you will have to sail in order to accomplish your
voyage, will be so many thousand miles, The navigator does it, and in some instances the computed ¹
distance and the actual distance by the log, will be found after a voyage os 4,000 or 5,000 miles to differ only a
few leagueS. In this case os the ‘⁴ Garrick,” the difference, though comparatively large, is less than 30

marine leagues‘.
