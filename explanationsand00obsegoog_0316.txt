bottom near the Harbor of Liefly on Disco Isle for seven weeks, 3ηά that he visited the spot each morning⁶on

the ice beneath which the fish lay for this length of time, and then arose to the surface and was captured. 1

do not remember at what season of the year this happened. What I have seen of the whaleS, their average
length of stopping down is one hour and fissy minuteS, and remain above about twenty-five minutes; but when

amongst the ice we seldom see them more than two risings, and many times never see them aster going down.

When they are irritated by having the harpoon stuck into them, they do not stop down so long as when disen-
tangled3 and still I believe I have seen a stuck fish stop down over two hours and come‚up apparently out of
breath3 and have seen them when I supposed they had made much exertion to pass under a heavy floe of ice, and
that they could not pass it, was obliged to return again completely out of breath. At such times they are captured
without a move to get away. Ι have seen a whale in a hole in the ice lay without going under for four hours,
and if not troubled probably would have lain longer. 1t is my belief that these whales do emigrate to the
West, and that there is a passage for them beneath the ice to seas beyond these soumis, or we should meet
them ostener going the other way, which we never do. These whales do not require a large hole to breathe
through; have often been found dead in the vicinity of Lancaster sound, with no mark upon them, in numbers.

From what 1 have heard, Ι believe them to be the same as the Polar or Russian whale, but never saw one.’'

Captain Roys to Lieut. Maury-Hong Kong, January 19tl2‚ 1851.

“I received your favor with pleasur e, and am very willing to communicate any knowledge Ι possess
respecting the whaling business. The whale of Behring’s straits and Baffin’s bay are the same; yet
they differ very much from the Kamtschatka or Northwest whale, or the right whale of the South 3333. 1
have known a whale to sound deep enough to take one thousand 3ηά fifty fathoms of line from the boatu
yet 1 never knew a whale to remain longer under water than 35 minutes‚ of the right whale species ς
3ηά one hour and 30 minutes for the sperm whale kind. Ι have never known them to sound under ice, that is,
more than 30 feet above the water’s 3311333, which was in the South 3333. 1 have never seen any ice to the
northward ofBehring’s straits more than 30 feet high. The right whale feeds upon a small animal substance,
which seems to vegetate and come to maturity every year, and perish like the vegetation upon the land. And
it is in only one state when the whale will eat it; consequently, in the northern hemisphere, in the month os
January, the sood is to be found from 300 to 350 North; 3ηά in February it is ripe for the whale3 a little far-
ther, in March 3 still sar-ther, and so on, until August, when it is as sar North as the Kamtschatka whales go,
which is 60ος while the seed from 350 to 400 becomes dead and unfit to nourish the whale, consequendy the
whale cannot live at that season in those latitudeS, while the humpback and finback take possession and seem
·to enjoy and revel in the food, after it has passed its stage for the right whale. The P olar whale's seed differs
a little from the others, and in January‚ may be found in 500 North, 3ηά in August, from 700 to the pole. 1
am firm in the opinion that the South is the same; but as no one has ever yet seen a right whale the opposite

of the Arctic whales, in the Antarctic, the matter still remains in doubt 3 and it is alamentable truth, thatthe

rohips of war who have visited those aeas are not able to tell us sor certainty the kinds os whales they saw there.
