cooler: a portion of its vapor is thus condensed‚ and comes down in the shape of rain. Therefore it is, that
under these calms we have a region os constant precipitation. ι

Old sailors tell us of such dead calms of long continuance here, of such heavy and constant rainS, that
they have scooped up fresh water from the surface of the sea.

The conditions to which this air is exposed here under the equator, are probably not such as to cause it

to precipitate all the moisture that it has taken up in its long sweep across the waterS.

Let us see what becomes of the rest—for nature, in her economy, permits nothing to be taken away from
the earth which is not to be restored to it again in some form, and at some time or other.

Consider the great rivers—the Amazon and the Mississippi for example—we see them· day after day, and
year aster year, discharging an immense volume of water into the ocean.

“ All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not sull.'' Ecc. i, ’7.

Where do the waters so discharged gc, and where do they come from ?

They come from their sourceS, you will say. But whence are their sources supplied ?—sor, unless what
the fountain sends forth be returned ¹⁰.it again, it will fail and be dry.

We see simply, in the waters that are discharged by these riverS, the amount by which the precipitation
exceeds the evaporation throughout the whole extent os valley drained by them—and by precipitation 1 mean
the total amount of water that falls from, or is deposited by the atmosphere whether as dew, rain, hail or snow.

The springs of these rivers are supplied from the rains of heaven, and these rains are formed of vapors

which are taken up stom the sea, that “it be not full,'' and carried up topthe mountains through the air.

“ Note the place whence the rivers corne, thither they return again.’'

Behold now the waters of the Amazon, of the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and all the great rivers of
America, Eurqpe and Asia, lifted up by the atmosphere, and flowing in invisible streams back through the air,
to their sources among the hills; and that through channels so regular, certain, and well defined, that the
quantity thus conveyed one year with the ‘other is nearly the same: for that is the quantity which we see running
down to the ocean through these rivers; and the quantity discharged annually by each river is, as sar as we can
judge, nearly constant.

We now begin to see what a powersul machine is the atmosphere3 and though it is apparently so capri·
cious and wayward in its movementS, here is evidence of order and arrangement which we must admit, and
proof which we cannot deny, that it performs this mighty office with regularity and certainty, and is therefore
as obedient to law as is the steam engine to the will of its builder.

It toc is an engine. The South scas themselveS, in all their vast extent, are the boiler for it, and the
northern hemisphere is its condenser.

The proportion between the land and the water in the northern hemisphere, is very different from the pro-
portion between them in the southern. ln the northern hemisphere, the land and water are nearly equally
divided. In the southern, there is several times more water than land. All the great rivers in the world are in

the northern hemisphege, where there is less ocean to supply thern. Whence then are their sources replenished?
