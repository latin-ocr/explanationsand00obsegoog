of days each in which there was rain, a calm, a fog, thunder and lightning, or a storm, and the quarter
‘from whence it blew.

This series is not yet ready for the preSS, though a vast amount of labor has been bestowed upon it as
well as· upon the otherS.

The manner in which these observations are collected from the quarry of Log-bookS‚—brought together
and discussed, and the officers at work upon them, reminds one of the sculptor: any single stroke os the
chisel, however well directed, does but little towards developing the figure, which in due time is to stand out
from the rude mass upon which he is engaged ; so with these observations 3 any single one, however accurate,
is in itself worth but hule. It is only by oft-repeated observationS, multiplied and brought together in suffi-
cient numbers to express their own meaning, that satisfactory and significant results can be obtained. Then,
like the piece os statuary to the repeated touch of the chisel, the charts speak for themselves, and all at once
stand out before the compiler, eloquent with facts which the philosopher never dreamed were lurking so near.

Among the various phenomena presented in the course of these investigationS, some have pointed to the
Moon and suggested the inquiry: Has the declination of the Moon any i'nfluence upon the hands of trade
winds and calme„ by moving the edges of their zones up and down the ocean, or by accumulating an excess
of atmosphere, first in one hemisphere, then in the other, according as the declination be North or South?

The Abstract Logs will in the course of time afford observations enough probably to enable me to answer
this question, for it is one of those questions to which a satisfactory reply, either in the affirmative or negative,

‘is equally desirabie.

The investigation of this problem was assigned to Passed Midshipman MathewS. His researches relate
entirely to the Atlantic. Before he had completed it he was ordered away to sea3 and Ι have not had force
since to continue them. But l am apprehensive that the true answer to the question will be so masked by
the effects of other causes in moving these trade wind bands up and down the ocean, that its purport will not
be perceived.

Perhaps the Pacific ocean, when there shall be observations enough made in it, will enable me to put this
question to rest.

Plate 111 is a sample of the Storm and Rain Chart.

As in the other case, so in this: the ocean is divided out into districts of 50 of latitude by 50 of longi·
tude for these investigationS, and whatever phenomenon is reported as occurring in one part of a district, is
assumed to occur m all parts of that district.

Between each pair of meridians having a space of 50 between them, are 12 lineS, sor the twelve months,

always beginning with December, the first winter month3 and horizontally between each pair of parallels for .

each 50 there are 13 lineS, eight of which are for gales from the eight semi-quadrants—one sor the calms—one
for rain—one for thunder and lightning—one for fogS, aud the other for the nu'mber of observations called
days, which have been obser-ved for each month 3ηά district. These last are expressed in figureS, (See Plate

111‚) and the others according to the method of “fives and tallies,” already explained for other chartS.
