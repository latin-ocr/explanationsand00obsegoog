The fine steam frigate Susquehanna also went to the coasts of China properly equi‘pped t‘or deep-sea

soundingS, but she has reported only one cast during the trip. I have also enlarged the table by the addition
of the soundings of the “Cyane,’' “Plymouth‚'' “Portsmouth and “Dolphin‚’' additional ones from tlie

“ Albany,'’ are likewise included. Some os the returns are meagre enough, but this table is greatly enriched by
the soundings of the two vessels last named, for their work is particularly interesting 3ηά valuable.

And here 1 take leave to remind my brother officerS, to whom the general order (page 1⁹74) is directed,

and whose special duty it is to look aster these soundingS, that the depths of that part os the ocean south of the
Cape Horu parallel of latitudo, and of that part south of a line t‘rom the Cape of Good Hope to Van Dieman's
Laud, have a special interest attached to them.

There, in that great waste of water which encircles the South Pole, the tidal wave which reaches our
shores is said to have its genesis·

*The chief region of water appears in reality to surround the South Pole, and if we recollect how
peculiar the nature os the Pacific, how much it is intercepted with coral reefs, and islands, 3ηά insular con·
tinents, we shall readily perceive how far it is removed from the condition os an equatorial canal of uniform,
nnimpeded, great depth ; presenting on the contrary, a σοι-31 barrier nearly impervious to tidal action.

“ The source of the tides is therefore to be sought in the great reservoir of ocean round the Southern Pole.
This polar reservoir i's agitated on opposite sides by the Moon in its alternate lower and upper transits,
3ηά by the Sun in a less degree. Here the great central agitation seems to commence, and hence on all sides,
it seems to flow northward& From the South Pole this great agitation flows into the Indian Ocean, and pro-
ceeding northward, the great tide-wave strikes with violence on the shores of Hindostan3 and finally, breaks
in the mouth os the Ganges, where it expends its force on the shores in the form of the well-known 3ηά
terrific bore of Hoogly. The Atlantic in like manner receives from the southern reservoir its great wave of
tides, which passes northward with impetuosity, and expends its forces on the shores of Britain 3ηά North
America, when again it becomes the enormous stream-tide of the British channel, and the destroying surge
os the Bay of Fundy, so well known to all marinerS. From the South in like manner the Pacific should
receive its great tide, even if barricaded out by innumerable submarine steppeS, 3ηά its thousand coral reess,
3ηά its myriads os happy islands, to whose calm seas no propagation of this great horizontally·acting wave
can gain access. Itis by depth and uninterrupted bottom only that 3 great wave like the tide can force
entrance—it is only the small waves raised by a local tempest that travel over the surface—an action like the
tide, extending uniformly to all depths of the ocean, cannot be propagated on a superficial coating alone.
The tides are built out of the Pacific by submarine workS, 3ηά enter it alone, and with difficulty, by the eastern
side of America, where diffused and rapidly diminishing, the tide extends 3 certain way, through the more
open parts of the sea, continually diminishing in intensity. In the North Pacific, we have neither the
bores of a Hoogly, nor the terrific tides of a Bay ot‘ Fundy. Itis thus that we shall best understand the
tides of these northern seaS, in tracing them back to their genesis by the joint action of the Sun 3ηά Moon

on the waters of the Southern·Polar Ocean. Then we must conceive that the elevation and horizontal mo·
