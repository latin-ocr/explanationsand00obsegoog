From what has already passed between Kupffer, the Russian meteorologist, (also in charge of the mines)
and mysels upon the subject, Ῑ am induced to believe that he is already authorized, by the proper authorities
in that country, to confer with the proper authorities in this, as to the establishment of a uniform system of
meteorological observations on the land, for the two countries.

The achievements os France and Germany, in the paths of science, and the monuments they have

erected in its name, do not admit us to doubt but that they too, would readily and most heartily second any
move which has for its object the great good of establishing, among civilized nations throughout the world,
a uniform and universal system of meteorologicapl observations.

There are other nations of Europe not a whit behind Germany and France in their devotion to science,
their love of the useful.

For these reasons Ῑ therefore respectsully suggest that as an amendm‘ent to the British proposition, a more
general system be- proposed. That England‚ France, Russia, and other nations be invited to co-operate with
then· ships, by‘eausing them to keep an abstract log, according to a form to be agreed upon, and that authority
be given to confer with the most distinguished navigators and meteorologistS, both at home and abroad, sor

the purpose of devising, adopting, and establishing a universal system of meteorological observations for the

sea as well as fo'r the land.

Suu—1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the l7th ultim0‚ which covered a
note to the Secretary of the Navy, from the Secretary of State, transmitting a communication from Her
Britannic Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires in this city, and a printed volume relative to the co-operation of the
Government of the United States with that of Her Britannic Majesty, in carrying out a plan which it has
adopted for the taking of uniform meteorological observations at foreign stations.

To enable me to state more sully the extent to which the navy is prepared to unite in the proposed co-
operation, than my recent connection with this Bureau enabled me to do from personal knowledge, a letter

was addressed to the superintendent of the Observatory-—a copy of this letter, and of Lieut. Maury’s reply,

are herewith enclosed.
With a set of wind and Current ChartS, and explanations of them, which have been furnished by Lieut.

Maury, I sorward Professor Espy's Third Report on Meteorology, and a communication received from Pro-

fessor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, on the same subject.

Collectively, they show the general character and extent os the meteorological observations which have
