which, at my request, a brother officer* conducted upon the habits of the Mississippi river as it passes Me1
in Tennessee, it appears that only about one-sixth of the water that is rained in that valley reaches the
through that river. The other five-sixths are taken up again into the air, and are carried off in the g·
channels of circulation to supply other systema of lake and river basina. But these five-sixths come fro
seas ; the clouds let them down in the Mississippi valley to rest, but the winda take them up again ; and s<
may be taken up and let down many times before they reach the sea again; for srom the sea they orig
came, and to the sea they are ultimately bound.

The hypothesis that the winds from South Africa and America do take the course through Europ
Asia which 1 have marked out for them, (Plate 1v‚) is supported by so many coincidenceS, to say the
that we are entitled to regard it as probably correct, until a train of coincidences as striking can be addu
shew that such is not the case.

Returning once more to a consideration of the geological agency of the winds in accounting for t]
pression of the Dead sea, we now see the fact most strikingly brought out before υς, that if the Str
Gibraltar were to be barred up, so that no water could pass through them, we should have a great depres=
water level in the Mediterranean. Three times as much water is evaporated from that sea as is retur-ne«
through the rivers. A portion of water evaporated from it is probably rained down and returned to it th
the rivers 3 but—supposing it to be barred up—-as the demand upon it for vapor would exceed the sup
rains and rivers, it would commence to dry up. As it siuks down, the area exposed for evaporation-
decrease, and the supplies to the rivers would diminish‚ until finally there would be established betwe
evaporation and precipitation an equilibrium‚ as in the Dead and Caspian seas; but sor aught we kno
water level of the Mediterranean might, before this equilibrium were attained, have reached a stage sar
that of the Dead sea level.

The Lake Tadjura is now in the act of attaining such an equilibrium: there are connected with
remains of a channel by which the water ran into the sea; but the surface of the lake is now 500 feet
the sea level audit is salting up. 1f not in the Dead sea, do we not, in the valley of this lake, find ou
ping some reason for the question. What have the winds had to do 'with the phenomena before us?

The winda, in this sense, are geological agents of great power. lt is not impossible but that thej
afford us the means of comparing, directly, geologtcal events which had taken place in one hemisphere
geological events in another: e. g., the tops of the Andes were once at the bottom of the sea. Which
oldest formation, that of the Dead sea, or the Andes? If the former be the older, then the climate
Dcad sea must have been hygrometrically very different from what it now is.

In regarding the wipds as geological agents, we can no longer consider them as the type of insta
We rather behold them now in the light of ancient and faithful chroniclers‚ which, upon being rightly con:

will reveal to us truths which nature has written upon their wings in characters as legible and enduring
has ever cngraved the history of geological events upon the tablet of the rock.
