The right whale taken in Anadir and Arctic seas is somewhat different in its organization from all other
right whales yet found3 they are called Romanas, having' a curve down with their heads from the spout hole
to the nose·end; so much so, as never to show their heads sorward of the spout·hole—either when blowing
or during their capture. ⁸

These whales are very large, black, and skin entirely smooth, no barnacles or other crustacea adhering.

They appear to be nourished by a different kind of sood3 their excrement, different; being moulded as if
cosme, and most, exceedingly, horribly fetid.

lf this be true, and Ι am told it is, since they are found in shallow water, is it not probable they may seed
on other fieb, or on vegetable matter found on the bottom ?

One of our most intelligent captains told me he struck a right whale' in the sea of Ochotslc, which went
down and remained hals an honr, when he succeeded in disengaging himself, and thus escaped. On taking
the harpoon on board, he noticed the hitehes and searons were covered with mud, he thought the whale had
been rolling on the bottom, and worked out the harpoons; the whale descended two hundred fathoms.

[intend calling on some of rny friendS, on their next voyage, to examine the contents of the Bow·
head's stomach.

John T. Conklin, second mate os the ship Huntsville, has been four voyages on the Northwest Coast3

two from Cold Spring, and two from Sag Harbor. Has never seen a sperrn whale on the Northwest Coast3

has seen them in almost all oceans in the Pacific, not higher North than 3505 in South latitude as high as 570,
off the pitch of Cape Hom in a snow storm. 110 barrels is as much oil as he ever knew a sperm whale to
make, and so on down to 5 barrels3 usual quantity 45 to 50 barrels· The sperm whales keep in warm lati·
tndeS, here, or on the equator, or near it.

The Russian whale has been seen as far Soutb as 490. The first he saw was with Capt. white in the
Tuscarora—-was then in the ochotsk sea, in the Huntsville, about Lat. 610 or 630; Long. 1530 East. Land
in sight 5 or 6 miles distant.

The quantit-y of oil from a Russian whale of large ‘size 210 to 220 barrelffiand down to about 90 barrels;
usually, 175 barrels from each Russian whale. This is probably the same kind as are taken in Behring’s
sti-aits. Find the common right whale in abundance' here. Also, some call these J apan whales. These
whaIeS, Mr. Conklin thinks, are similar to the Greenland whale‚ but he has never seen the latter.

The right whale keeps to the North of 300 North, and South os 300 South--never go near the equator.
Has heard osone taken near the Sandwich Islands or the passage, in about Lat. 190 3 has taken one.

260 barrels down to 15 barrels, usually about 75 barrels, are taken in all oceans, except from 300 North
to 300 South.

Calisornia Grey--usually 25 to 30 barrels, Pin-back 2-——does not chase them ;--a1·e not of sufficient value ;

-may make 15 to 30 barrels; some do not make any. Sulphur whale, about the same 3-heard of one that
made 60 barrels—are not sought aster. Grampus z—are small 3——may make a barrel or two ;-—similar to the
Black Fish. Black Fish make about one barrel, and equal to sperm oil, and like the Fin·back and the Sul-

phur bottom, ³2} seen in all seas, and in all latitudes t—cross the equator and go elsewhere. Hump·back whale
