1 should add, that since ascertaining the greater tenacity of the waxed line, we use it altogether in these

deep soundingS.

I shall continue these experiments on all practical occasions so long as ‘our materials last.

Pensacola—July 15th, 1851.—1 have the honor to submit to you the following report of our sounding op-
erations since the 19th April. We have improved every opportunity, but owing to the nature of the service
on which the ship has been employed, Ι am not able to present you with as important results ‚as I could have

wished.
April l9th, 1851.—Latitude 230 21’ North, longitude 820 44’ West, got bottom with 995 fathomS, waxed

line, time of running 16 minuteS, 48 secondS. Temperature air 790, temperature water 800. On this occa·
sion it was quite calm, and the line ran down perpendicularly, the sea being so smooth we were enabled to
let the shot take the line off the reel, without attempting to pay it out, as we usually do, when there is ‘any
motion, this accounts perhaps sor the length of time the shot occupied in descending.

April 20th‚ 1851.-0ff the TortugaS, dropped a shot overboard expecting to find shoal water, but 1 was
somewhat surprized to find only 21 fathoms, The line proving very strong, the shot was hauled up from that
depth and secured. 1 mention this circumstance only to show you that some parts of the line furnished are of
excellent quality. -

April 21st, 185l.—Latitude 250 19' North, longitude 830 41’ West, got bottom in 52 fathoms with the
patent lead. Temperature air 820, temperature water 780.

April 22d, 1851.—Latitude 260 43’ North, longitude 840 41' West, got bottom in 137 fathoms. Tempe·
rature air 790, temperature water 780.

April 23d, 185l.—Latitude 290 12’ North, longitude 860 01' West, got bottom in 152 fathomS. Tempe·

rature air 760, temperatur-e water 720.

No other opportunity sor sounding occurred until the 13th June, on a passage from Havana to Pensacola3
on the evening of that day, being in latitude 270 00’ North, longitude 550 43’ West, we got bottom with
1327 fathomS, waxed line. Time of running 27 minutes 31 secondS. Temperature air 850, temperature
water 840. Drift, at the rate of a half a mile an honr.

June 14th, 1851.—At 9 A. M., in latitude 270 55’ North, longitude 850 44’ West, got bottom with 376
fathoms line 3 some mistake was made in noting the time of running. Drift nothing. Temperature air 850,
temperature water 840. At 6 P. M., of the same day, in latitude 280 27’ North, longitude 850 54’ West, got
bottom with 220 fathoms line. Time of running 2 minutes 8 seconds. Temperature air 850, temperature

water 840. Drift nothing.

Our line is nearly all expended3 we have about 2500 fathoms remaining, and there is none in store here

for future operations.''
