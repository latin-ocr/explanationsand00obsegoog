Captain N. A. Bachelder, os the batque “ Imaum,” sailed from Salem to San Francisc0‚ October 16111,
1850. Η3 also had the Charts on board, took the new route, crossed 50 N. in 340 W. , and the Line in 350,
aster a fine run of 31 dayS. He stood on for three days more, and until he reached 40 ]Ο’ 8., ἰ11 350 13’ W„
meeting no current. But instead of taking advantage of the slants (the wind varying from E. by S. 10 S. E.
by S.) or of making short and long stretches—as to the advantages of which 1 have so earnestly endeavored to
impress navigators when they happened to be pinched here—he stood on, amidst all this veering and hauling
of the wind, (except for twelve hourS, the day he crossed the Line, when he steered N. Ε. by E. 3 and again,
in latitude 40 8., longitude 350, when he stood four hours N. Ε.) Finally he put about, stood to the north·
ward and eastward, and reached the Line again, after an absence of seven dayS‚ in 310 W„ srom which posi-
tion he cleared St. Roque‚ without difficulty, passing about 20 to windward of it. In ten days from the line
this time, and in seventeen from his' crossing it the first time, he was south of Rio. Thus making the passage,
notwithstanding the falling to leeward, and losing a week in consequence, in eight or ten days less than the
average time by the old route.

Indeed 1 have no doubt but that his difficulty, as it waS, in getting by St. Roque‚ was less than it would
have been in clearing the equatorial “ doldrum8,'’ had he taken the old route.

With regard to the current os St. Roque‚ he remarks ι “ This'’ (meeting a current os 20 miles N. W. by
W. in latitude 20 17‘ S.‚ longitude 340 01· 350 W.) “ this is the first time for six days in whichI have expe-
rienced the least current.'’ He had then been down to St. Roque‚ and was on his way back to the Line. And
to show that that much dreaded current is not always in motion here, 113 continues, “ and on my way, last
voyage to California, the N. Ε. trades falling me, 1 was obliged to cross the equatorin longitude 320 30', No—
vember 20, 1849, in three days cleared Cape St. Roque wnh little or no current.” ἡ

For the guidance of navigators who follow the new route, and are pinched in clearing St. Roque‚ as they

110 doubt will occasionally be, 1 repeat the following suggestions:

From the Line in longitude 330 Cape St. Roque bears S. S. W. From this crossing place, in a smart
ship that will fetch where she lookS, a S. E. wind all the way from the Line, would just prevent the vessel
from clearing. But the chances are more than a hundred to 0113, that the wind will not hang steadily at S. Ε.
311 1113 way srom the Line to St. Roque. 1f it haul to Ε. S. E. you can lay up and clear. If it haul to S. S.
Ε. you can put about and make easting.

But suppose the wind holds steadily at S. Ε. or at any other point which will prevent you from clearing
the Cape3 draw a line from your place on the Chart to the Cape, and avoid falling to the west of that line, by
taking advantage of slantS, or by beating, accordingly as you may have the wind, and making long and short

etretches. lquote the case of the “ Stag Hound,'' as an example.
