The plan of conducting these investigations is by spaces of 50 square, and the observations are so entered
as to show at a glauce the number of days sor each month spent in each square; the number of days in which
whales-——and whether they are sperm or right—have been seen3 also, the years in which whales of either kind
were seen, and the years in which they were not seen, in any given square.

As observation after observation in such an immense field was recorded day after day, with the most un·

tiring industry, and as the oft repeated process finally began to express a meaning, l was surprised to find the
lines for entering the right whale were blankS, through certain districts of the ocean, from one side of, the chart
to the other. Finally it was discovered that the torrid zone is to this animal forbidden ground, and that it is
physically as impossible for him to cross the equator as it would be to cross a sea of flame. In short, these
researches shew that there is a belt from two to three thousand miles in breadth‚ and reaching from one side os
the ocean to the other, in which the right whales are never found.

Hence the discovery that the fish called the right whale in the Northern hemisphere is not the fish which
goes by this name in the Southern: that the right whale of Bebring's Straits and the whales of Baffin’s Bay
are probably the same anima13 and if so, the conclusion is almost inevitable that there is at times at least, an
open water communication through the polar regions between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans; for this animal
not being able to endure the warm waters os the equator, could not pass from one ocean to the other unless by
way of the Arctic regions.

The investigations connected with these animals have also pointed out to us the great currents of warni
water which keep up the ocean circulation of the Pacific—it might be said of the globe3 for as we study their

habits, these dumb creatures teach us by their instincts that there are continuous currents in the sea between

places the most remote.

With the aid of what the whales have taught uS, in connection 'with what we have learned from other
sourceS, we can now ‚almost prove the existence of a continuous current of water from the borders of the Red
sea into the English Channel. The current, which has its genesis partly in the Red sea, and partly in the
Indian ocean and its contiguous bayS, is bifurcated off the African coast by a cold current from the South.
And were it possible to throw into the Red sea two bottles properly marked and labelled, which would not be
drifted out of the current, but which would separate at the forks of the stream, these two bottles would, or
might paSS, one around Cape Horn, and the other around the Cape of Good Hope3 and meeting again in the

tropical regions of the Atlantic ocean, it would,theoretically, be possible for them to drift into the Caribbean sea ;—-

thence through the Gulf of Mexico 3—and by the Gulf Stream out again into the Atlantic ocean ; and by its waters
they might be cast up together on the shores of the British IslandS, as the drift of the Gulf Stream is often cast.
Ξ There is an under current from the Red sea, and the course of the supposed bottles would be with that
under current out into the Gulf os Aden ; thence, rising to the surface os the Arabian sea—an immense cauld·
ron without any escape, as from our Gulf of MexicO, for its heated waters to the N orth,—-they would be drifted
to the south in the currents from this sea: arrived near the Cape of Good Hope, this current is bifurcated by

a cold one from the South going to replace the waters which it has &Qeyed from the North.
