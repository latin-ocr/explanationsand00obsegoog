of the llth. They were made with the line dry and unwaxed. And though it was thought at the time, that
soundings were obtained, yet subsequent experiment satisfied both Capt. l’latt and Lieut. Taylor, that the
results were not to be relied on. 1 am also well satisfied that the cast was not a good one.

Thbse soundings, each of about the same duration——27 or 28 minutes-—give nearly the same depths and
the same rate. See the column Bate, for the rate of fathoms per minute, at which the shot descended. These
would seem to repudiate the soundings of December eth, in which with a 10 pound lead for the weight, 325
fathoms more os line only ran out in one bour and three minutes, than ran out on the 6th, in 27 minutes.

At first these soundings suggested the inquiry3 did not the shot reach the bottom on all four of the coca·
sions ; and was it not the sweep of the current below, probably the cold current from the North, which theory

suggests to be running counter to the Gulf stream, which continued to take the-linc from the reel ‘aster the

shot was lauded? ,
'The soundings of December 29th, J anuary loth, and February 18th‚ were made with waxed line. Time,

depth and rate, all show considerable agreement, notwithstanding there is not a perfect accordance as to
circumstances. At the casts of 17 minutes, there was drift-more at the first than at the last.-At the 18
minute sounding, there was no drist, still the rate os descent during the 18 minutes, is less per minute than·
during either of the two others ; which, as the rate is in a decreasing ratio, in consequence of the increased
resistance afforded by an increasing length of line, which the shot has to drag aster it, shows reasonable con·
formity.

1t is worthy of note, that these three casts were made in that part of the ocean in which Lieut. Walsh
discovered that remarkable under-current, which ran off with his barrega, and excited to such a pitch the

astonishment of the sailors.

The strain of an under-current would be very great on a great length of line. Persons who are not
familiar with the force which a current exerts upon the bight of a rope, as for instance, when the two ends are
made fast on opposite bauks of a river, and the middle suffered to get into the current-may form some idea
of that force by calling to mind the action os the wind upon the stn‘ng of a kite.

‘ Is we imagine still water to be above and below a submarine current intercepted in one os these sound-
ings, it will readily be perceived, how, after the shot has passed through this current, and is still descending,
it will have to draw the line after it in the sbape of a loop. In this case, the resistance afforded by the line

would be greatly increased, and it would go out with whatever rate the shot might have, plur twice the rate
of the current nearly.

Again, when there is both an upper and under-current, but in opposite directions, the shot instead of
having to draw the line down as a curved or crooked line, would, is the two currents were equal, have to draw
it down as a straight line, but along an inclined plane. In this case, the shot would sink slower, but the line
would run faster off the reel than it would were the shot going through still water, and drawing the line off
normally. In this case, the effect of the two currents upon the descent of the shot and the rate of the line,
would be very nearly as though there were only a surface current, with the joint velocity of the hypothetical

upper and‘ lower currents.
