At any rate whether his observations were unisormly too great or too small, is immaterial to my present
purpose, which is to show the remarkable variations discovered by him in the pressure of the atmosphere, par·
ticularly during his descent ot‘ the Amazon.

At Nauta, in Peru, which is about 2,700 miles above the mouth of the Amazon, it appears there was an
accumulation of atmosphere sufficient to cause a pressure nearly equal to the ordinary atmospherical pressure at
the sea level. In other words, this traveller found himself under a ridge or mountain of atmosphere, the pressure
os which away up on the side of the Andes was nearly as great as is the mean pressure of the atmosphere
down upon the sea shore.

Drifting along down the river from Nauta, Lieut. Herndon, much to his surprise, found that according to his
boiling point, he was ascending or going up·hill quite rapidly‚ though by the river and his own senseS, he was
descending. Finally, by his boiling point,at EgaS, he ceased to ascend, and again began to descend accord-
ing to it and his own senses also. ⁸

It is worthy of remark, that M. Castelnau, the French traveller, who preceded Herndon, observed the same
phenomenon with regard to the high barometer, at Nauta, that the American did with regard to the boiling point.

Their measurementS, which were both made on a bluff or high bank of the river, differ from each other
as to the height above the sea level, 51 feet. At the next place—Pebas-where they both again observed,
‘the difference between them is 138 feet. At Barra 0180, they both observed. Here,too‚ the German habenas,
Spix⁸ and MartiuS, observed. These observations give the height of Barra, by Castelnau, 293 feet ; by Herndon‚
1,380; by Spix and MartiuS, 522 feet above the level of the sea. M. Castelnau complains that in his descent
of the Amazon his barometer got out of order, and that in consequence, he was compelled to reject a portion of
his observations. Was it because his barometer made him apparently go up hill, as Herndon's boiling point
did, when he knew he was going down stream?

It is to be hoped, if this should ever meet the eye os that clevet French traveller, he will have the good-
ness to let the world see those rejected observations.

Moreover, it would probably depend upon the season os the year whether barometrical observations along
the Amazon, and to the North of it, would detect this supposed repetition of the Andes in the air. When
the equatorial calms are upon the Amazon, as for a month or two annually they are, the trade winds do not
blow at Nauta or Pebas, consequently there would be no accumulation of- air then, and from this cause, over those
places· But at the other season, when the S. Ε. trades are felt at Pebas and Nauta, and when they are impinging
and pressing against the Andes, 1 imagine they accumulate and pile up too, and will make the barometer feel the
weight of this accumulation. Now, the fact that those travellers passed along the Amazon at different seasons

of the year, may help to account for this extraordinary differ-enee among their barometrical observations.

Reasoning from these facts and conjectures, Ι have been led to ask the question—that if there be an

elevation in the atmosphere to windward of the Andes, ought there not ho be a hollow or depression in it to

leeward of them also? With the view of getting some light with regard to the answer to this question, 1 have
