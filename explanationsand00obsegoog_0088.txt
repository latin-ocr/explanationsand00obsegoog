Only the following genera belong alone to the sea water:

CoscinodiscuS, Grammatophora,
DiploneiS, Biddulphia,
Goniothecium.

“ And beside these, all the polythalamia and some spongoliths are sea formatioris. Sp. ClavuS, censcep

Caput serpentis, obtusa robusta.

parts of the world, even in Europe and Africa The following are American ε

Arcella constricta, Eunotia quaternaria, Stauroneis dilatata,

Desmogonium guyanense, quinaria, Surirella peruana,

“ There is in Africa no trade wind, and no sursace of red dust which can supply the trade wind. ¹
sand of the Sahara is white and grey; the cloud-dust of the trades is cinnamon-colored. Since, according
experience, an upper trade wind corresponds with the lower at the Peak of Tenneriffe, and since the lowe
not an African wind, but different from the harmattan, it follows that only the upper wind can carry the du:
Africa3 and since probably it does not continue beyond, falling there, and becoming the lower trade wind
precipitates the dust in that region. The fact that South American forms have been observed in the dust ol
trade winds gave rise originally to this theory, and is still favorable to it, and moreover the number of tl
forms continually increases. The American dust, therefore, raised up in the region of equatorial calms
ascending (South American) currents of air, and carried by the upward eastward trade winds to Africa, by
vertical downward current, is returned to America through the lower western trades), unless it have been ]
viously deposited in space. -

“ That this dust is coarsest near Africa may be explained by this direct sinking down in that regi
while lower in the ocean it is more sifted out; but the dust of March 9, 1838, is not coarser than that from ἔ
Jago in the Oape Verde Islands‚ in 1833. Thus, the place of falling down may always show the coarsest pa

“ It is worthy os remark, that North America is seldom reached by the dust, and no ship in the Pac
Ocean, whence we may conclude that the constant dust-cloud zone of the upper atmosphere truly belongs o
the Atlantic northern trades; and over America, when it begins to appear in the South, wholly sails in the Nor

as over the Sandwich IslandS‚ and consequently cannot be brought down by fire-meteors and meteoric stoneS.

Itis now proved that there is a perpetual upper current of air srom South America to North Afri<
