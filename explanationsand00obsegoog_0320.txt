‘⁴ Your favor of the 28111 1111. cameto hand ; contents duly noticed; and in reply, say, 1 have with pleasure
made your ‘ grateful acknowledgments ' to Capt. Howland, of Ship Citizen, for his ‘ kindness and attention,'

33 you directed.

Capt. H. says further as regards sperm whales staying for days under water, that in cruising for instance 011
01 1133111111 equator, round the GallapagOS, and westward also on the coast of Japan—these places are cited as
celebrated 113111113, where hundreds of ships are cruiSIng near each other at the same time,—that not unfre-
quently no whales are found for several weekS‚ when all at once, as is by magio, the ground for hundreds of
1111133, will be found abounding with sperm whales3 when the great work of slaughter simultaneously begins.
· They at last disappear, and suddenly and unexpectedly as they came. After the decks are cleared and 011 stowed.
below deckS, sail is again crowded on the ship3 while cruising they often speak each other, 3311139011 the
success they have had. lt is then known that the whole fleet found whales about the same day, and lost them
near the same time. 1 entirely agree with Capt. H. and others ot great experience in their opinion as above3
and what is very extraordinary‚ when the whales are first seen they are slow in their movements, and headed
every point of the compass.

The sea elephant has never yet been seen out upon 1113 ‘open sea, either by their pursuers or whalers3 they
are first seen crawling up the 1133011, where they bring forth their young3 and at other 33330113 10 shed 1113110031.

They therefore must 131113111 for months under the surface, or on the bottom ; 1111311131· they carry with them
3 133311011 of compressed air to seed upon, or whether they die and are brought to life again, God only knows,
Ι do not. The ‘ Notice to Whalemen ' sent me Ι 11313 furnished to owners and masters as they have called3
still 11313 3 3111311 supply on hand; happy to say they were most gratefully received.

The ‘long looked for’ „Whale vChart (Series F) 1133 31 length arrived, (0113 dozen 009133,) they are

appreciated very highly by all intelligent 111311, especially owners and masters· A large supply is now or soon

will be wanted for distribution.'' ⁸

“ Τ113 Wbale Chart is 3913010113 jewel; it seems to have walced up the merchants and masters to the

favorable: it is sought for by all interested in whaling. ⁴* ⁴ ‚ ⁶
