“ 4. T-he contents of this last sirocco dust are again not only like those of the very distant Cape V

IslandS, but even so very like what has fallen there {or sixteen yearS, that the difference is sar exceeded by

agreement, and seems only to lie in the defect of our knowledge.

even though the investigations include so sew occasions, neither from one limited place, where, indeed, vary
moist seasons produce varying organisms, nor generally can it be an unimportant instantaneous upraising ε
local dust by whirlwind, it appears to belong necessarily, to a more constant series of relation3‚ a const
cloud-duat swimming in the atmosphere‚ and always receiving new contenta, which a hurricane accidente
meeting may scatter in any direction.

coincide with the phenomenon‚ we cannot now decide3 but it may be use-ful to point out the possibility of st

a coincidence.
“7. The whole number of organic corpuscules detected in the nine kinds of dust yet known, and

strikingly similar, amounts now to 19 specieS, namely:

“As in the Atlantic memor-dust, so also in that of LyonS, the phytolitharia are very numerouS, wh

Atlantic‚ we obtain the following highly remarkable relations:
