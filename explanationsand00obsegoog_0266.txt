the way it is belo wthe surface, and far beyond the propelling reach of any wind. And there is every reason
to believe that this polar current is quite equal in volume to the Gulf stream. Are they not the effects of like
causes? If SO, what have the trade winds to do with the one more than the other?

‘⁴ Nay more. At the very season of the year when the Gulf Strearn is rushingin greatest volume through
the Straits of Florida and hastening to the North with the greatest rapidity, there is a cold stream from Baffin’s
Bay, Labrador, and the coasts of the North, running to the South with ‚equal velocity. Where is the trade
wind that gives the high level to Baffin's Bay, orthat even presses upon or assists to put this current in motion?
The agency of winds in producing currents in the deep sea must be very partial.

“ These two currents‘ meet off the· Grand Banks, where the latter is divident. One part of it underruns
tbe Gulf Stream, as is shown by the icebergs which are carried in a direction tending across its course. The
probability is, that this ‘ fork ’ continues on towards the Soutlz, and runs into the Caribbean Sea, sor the tem·
perature of the water at a little depth there, has been found sar below the mean temperature of the earth, and
quite as cold as at a corresponding depth off the Arctic shores of Spitzbergen. ⁹· ⁸ ⁸

“ More water cannot come srom the equator or the pole than goes to it. If we make the trade winds to
cause the former, some other wind must produce the latter; but these, cold currents for the most part, and for
great distanceS, are su-bmarine, and therefore beyond the influence of windS. Hence, it should appear that
winds have little to do with the general system of aqueous circulation in the ocean.

‘⁴ The other ‘ sork’ runs between us and the Gulf Stream to the South as already described. As far as it
has been traced, it warrants the belief that it too runs up to seek the so called 'righer level of the Mexican
Gulf· Ο 0 Ο 0 Ο *O Δ 0

‘⁶ Therefore this immense volume of water, in passing from the Baharnas to the Grand BankS, meets with
an opposing force in the shape of resistance, sufficient in the aggregate to retard it two miles and a half the θ
minute, and this only ‘in its eastwardly rate. There is, doubtless‚ another force quite as great, retarding it
towards the north, for its course shows that its velocity is the resultant os two forces acting in different direc-
tions· If the former resistance be calculated according to received laWS, it will be found equal to several
atmosphereS. And by analogy, how inadequate must the pressure of the gentle trade winds be to such resist-
ance, and to the effect assigned them‘? If, therefore, in the proposed' inquiry we search for a propelling power
nowhere but in the higher level of the Gulf, we must admit, in the head of water there, the existence of a force
capable os putting in motion and driving over a plain, at the rate of 5 miles the hour, all the waters as fast as
they can be brought down by 3‚000 such streame as the Mississippi river—a power at least sufficient to over·
come the resistance required to reduce from two miles and a half to a few feet per minute, the velocity of
a stream that keeps in perpetual motion one-fourth of all the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.

“ But, in addition to this, may there not be a peeuliar system of laws not yet revealed, by which the
motion of fluids in such large bodies is governed uben moving through each other in currents of differenttem·
perature. That currents of sea· water, having different temperatureS, do not readily commingle, is shown by

the [act already mentioned: that the line of separation between the warm waters of the Gulf and the cold
