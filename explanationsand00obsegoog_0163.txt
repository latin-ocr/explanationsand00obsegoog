away by the ice. The loss of it, however, I was glad to perceive, did not materially affect the sailing or
working qualities of the vessel. ‚The rudders were shipped, and we once more were ready to move as effi·
cient as the day we left New York.

Steering to the S. Ε. and working slowly through the loose but heavy pack, on the 9th we parted from
the Rescue, in a dense fog, she taking a different lead from the one the Advance was pursuing.

On the morning of the lOth, with a fresh breeze from the north, under a press of sail, we forced a way
into an open and clear sea, in latitude 650 30¹, about 35 miles from the spot in which we were liberated.

The wind, which in the ice was merely fresh, proved to be in clear water a gale, with a heavy sea run-
ning. Through this we labored until the next morning, when it moderated. The coast of Greenland was in
sight.

Our course was now directed for the Whale Fish islands (the place of rendezvous appointed for our con·
sort) which we reached on the 16th3 not, however, without having some difficulty in getting through the un·

usual number of bergs which lined the coast. In an encounter with one we lost a studding·sail boom.

1 had two objects in visiting these islands—-that of verifying our chronometer8‚ and to recruit our some-
what debilitated crews. The latter object, 1 learned on arriving, could be much better attained‚ and the for·
mer quite as well, at Lively, on Disco island, for which place Ι bore up, leaving orders for the Rescue to fol-
low us· We arrived on the 1‘7th, and the Rescue joined us the day after.

The crews were indulged with a run on shore every day that we remained, which they enjoyed exceed·
ingly aster their tedious winter's confinement. This recreation, together with a few vegetables of an anti·
scorbutic character that were obtained, was of much benefit to them· There were no fresh 'provisions to be
had here at this season of the year. Fortunately one of the Royal Danish Company's vessels arrived from

copenhagen while we remained, and from her we obtained a few articles that we stood much in need of. The

company's store was nearly exhausted, but what remained was kindly placed at our disposal.

On the 22d‘, our crews being much invigorated by their exercise on terra firma, and the few still afflicted
with scnrvy being in a state of convalescence, we got underway with the intention of prosecuting the object
of the expedition for one season rnore at least.

From the statements made to us at Lively‚ the last winter had been an extraordinary one. The winds
had prevailed to an unusual degree from the N. W„ and the ice was not at any time fixed. The whaling fleet
had passed to the northward some time previous to our arrival.

On the 24th we met with some obstruction from the ice off Hare island, and on the following day our
progress was completely arrested by it at Stovr'ie island. In seeking for a passage, we got beset in the pack
on a lee shore, near to which we were carried by the drifting ice, and narrowly escaped being driven on the
rocks. After getting out os this difficulty, we availed ourselves of every opening in the ice, and worked
slowly to the northward near the shore.

On the lst of J uly we were off the Danish port and settlement of Proven3 and as the condition of the
ice rendered farther progr-ess at present impossible, we went in and anchored, to wait for a change.

Here, again, some scurvy grass was collected, and the men allowed to run on shore.
