From this, the navigator will see also, that along this part of the February route, the northern side is
rather the windward side3 and that, therefore, when winds are free it is better to keep, along this part of the
route, somewhat to the North of the projected line.

After crossing latitude 200 N., longitude 400 W„ he will likewise see that he is there still liable to be

headed off by winds from the northward and eastward‚ and that, consequently, when the wind comes out dead
abead, he should stand off on the starboard tack3 and that, when the winds are fair, he should keep the pro·-
jected traek to the southward and westward of him, say generally 40 or 50 miles,

He is recommended to steer straight from d to d when the winds are fair3 and when he gets thrown off .
his course, instead of getting out of his way to get back to the projected track, he should be guided by the
“ Pilot Chart,'’ and run parallel to this track, or otherwise, acc’ording to the “ Pilot Chart.”

Similar tables, with complete sailing directionS, are in the course of preparation for every mouth, and all
the principal routes across the ocean.

These present tables from that publication are given for the information of those navigators who are on
the eve of sailing on voyages beyond the equator.

These who desire to try these routes should project the route for the mouth on the chart as far as the
equatur3 arrived there, let aline be drawn from the point of actual crossing to Cape St. Augustine3 and then
aim to keep this line under the (ee, so as to have it at least 20 or 30 miles to the westward when the ship
oros'ses the parallel of 60 or 70 South.

After that, the winds haul moreto the eastw'ard, and there will be no difficulty in laying up S. S. W„ or

even as high as South.
1f the ship be headed off to the west of her course or to. the west of said line to St. Angustiae, she should

take advantage of the first “slant,’' taek, stand east, and make short and long legs until she can clear the
land.

This part of the route is the turning point of the passage. By studying the charts as well as the tables,
navigators will see, that with attention and management between the equator aad 60 South, they will have
little or no difficulty in making either a S. S. W. course goodon one tack, oran east course on the other 3 and
when they find it necessary to stand to the eastward, they should never stand farther unless they can make
southing also, than to bring 20 or 30 miles to the leeward of them, a straight line drawn from 310 on the
equator just so as to clear the land about Cape St. Angustiae. In this part of the route more than iu all others,
the navigator should study the stante, aad take advantage of all of them.

1 recommend these routeS, it should be understood, only to vessds which can sail within six points of the
wind. 1 would not advise any vessel that cannot do this, to attempt them, sor she will be apt to fall to lee-
ward, and then she will find it difficult and tedicus to get up agaim

There are other parts of the routes in which it is also necessary to study the “ slants.'‘ For instance ε

take that part of the February route which lies between the parallels of 200 and 15Ο N. It will be observed
that though but one of the 25 observations from which this part of the route is determined, gives the wind
