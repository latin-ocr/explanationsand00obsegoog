The prevailing direction of what are called the N. E. trade winds is, as nearly as the observations which

mariners usually furnish enable me to determine, about E. N. E.

By resolving the forces which it is supposed are the principal forces that put those winds in motion, viz:
calorific action of the Sun, and diurna] rotation of the earth, we are led to the conclusion, that the latter is
much the greater of the two in its effects upon the trade winds of the northern hemisphere. But not to such
an extent is it greater in its effects upon those of the southern. We have seen that those two opposing cur-
rents of wind are so unequally balanced that one recedes before the other, and that the current from the southern
hemisphere is larger in volume3 i. e.‚ it moves a greater zone or belt of air. The S. E. trade winds discharge
themselves over the equator‚—i. e., across a great circle‚—into the region of equatorial calms; while the N. E.
trade winds discharge themselves into the same region over a parallel os latitude, and consequently over a small
circle. If therefore we take what obtains in the Atlantic as the type os what obtains entirely around the earth,
as it regards the trade winds, we shall see that the S. E. trade winds keep in motion more air than the N. E.
do, by a quantity at least proportioned to the difference between the circumference os the earth at the equator,
and the circumferente of the earth at the parallel of latitude of 9Ο N. For if we suppose that those two
perpetual currents of air extend the same distance from the sursace of the earth, and move with the same
velocity, a greater volume from the South would flow across the equator in a given time, than would flow from
the North over the parallelos 9Ο in the same time; the ratio between the two quantities would be as rad.
to the sec. os 90. Besides this, the quantity of land lying within and to the North of the region of the N. E.
trade winds is much greater than the quantity within and to the South of the region of the S. E. trade winds.
In consequence of this, the mean level os the earth’s surface within the region of the N. E. trade winds is, it
may reasonably be supposed, somewhat above the mean level of that part which is within the region of the
S. E. trade winds. And as the N. E. trade winds blow under the influence of a greater extent of land surface
than the S. E. trades do, the former are more obstructed in their course than the latter, by the forests, the

mountain rangeS, unequally heated surfaces and other such like inequalitieS.

As already stated, the charts show that the momentum of the S. E. trade winds is sufficient to push the
equatorial limits of their northern congeners back into the northern hemisphere, and to keep them at a mean,
as far North as the 9th parallel os North latitude. Besides this fact, our investigations also indicate that
while the N. E. trade winds, so called, make an angle in their general course of &about 23⁰ with the equator,
(E. Ν. Ε.,) those of the S. E. make an angle of '30⁰ or more with the equator (S. E. by E.) I speak of
those in the Atlantic ε thus indicating that the latter approach the equator more directly in their course than do ‘
the otherS, and that consequently, the effect of the diurnal rotation of the earth being the same for like paralleIS,

North and South, the calorific influence of the Sun, exerts more power in giving motion to the southern than
to the northern system of Atlantic trade windS.

That such is the case in nature is rendered still more probable from this consideration: all the great

deserts are in the northern hemisphere, and the land sursace is also much greater on our side of the equator
