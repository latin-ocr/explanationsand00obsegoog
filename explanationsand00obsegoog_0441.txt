Independent of the information that has been elicited by these investigatione. connected with the wind
and Current Charts, but little was known by navigators as to the winds and currents after doubling Cape

Horn', on the California route.

Navigators knew indeed that on that route they had to cross the belt both of the S. E. and of the N. E.
trade windS. But in what longitude to cross thern 3—-between what meridians are these trade winds most con·
stant, steady and fresh ;—and between what meridians is it less difficult to cross the belt of equatorial calms
which separate these two systems of trade winds 3—-2nd when, at what distance from the coast, are the ‚light
airs and calms of the. Horse LatitudeS‚ which are found on the polar borders of the S. Ε. as well as of the N.
Ε. tradeS, less vexatious? These are some of the questions to which definite answers must be given, before
it can be asserted with confidence that this or that is certainly the best route to California.

To enable me to do this Ι want for every 50 of longitude between the coast and 1300 or 1400 W., and
all the way up, srom the parallel of Cape Horn to 400 N., at least one hundred a'›stract logs for each
month. In short, from l0,000 to 15‚000 abstract logs of vessels navigating this part of the ocean are wanted,
each one of which shall contain faithful reports as to the winds and currents encountered between the western
coasts of this continent and the meridians 1300 or 1400 West, in order that I may point out to navigators
the best route for each month, with the assurance that subsequent experience so far from inducing navigators
to change, will only confirm them as to the accuracy of this route.

Having exhausted my materials for Pilot Charts of this route, and having found them insufficient as to

data for the best trackS, I have overhauled the whole series of log books in my possession, for California pas·

Sages, From thern is derived the following tabular statement, giving the name of the vessel; the year3 the,

number of days’ passage from the U. S. generally, . to the equator in the Pacific3 the place and month of
crossing the Equator3 and the number of days thence to California. The crossings on the Equator and of
various parallels of latitude are also given. The average monthly passages from the U. States to each
crossing, and thence to California are also shown. Now if we had the tracks of some one or two hundred

vessels sor each crossing in each mouth, we should be able to pronounce with confidence as to the best place

for crossing these parallels in the different seasons.

Fur instance: in March 1 have the track of but one vessel, the “Acasta,” that crossed between 120ο and
1250 West; and she had a passage to California of 199 days. I have not one in this month that crossed
between 950 and 1000;ο four that crossed between 1000 and 105⁰—but only two of these were direct from
the Atlantia portS. The mean passage of these two to California was 141 dayS. The average of the five
that crossed between 1050 and 1100 was 134 days3 and of the four that crossed between 1150 and 1200, the
average passage was 132 dayS. In all sor March from the Line to California, we have the logs of twenty—one
vessels ; and it appears srom these that the average passage from the Line to Calisornia is the same, (28 day8,)
whether you cross in 1000 or 1250 or at any intermediate point.

Nevertheless, if we examine the ships that made the several crossingS, we shall find, in some cases at least,
