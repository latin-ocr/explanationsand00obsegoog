Influence os the Gulf Str-eam on the stade os modestam*

Before the Gulf Stream was known to practical navigatorS, the course of trade between England and
America was such as to make Charleston the half-way house between the mother country and the New England
StateS, including Pennsylvania and New York among the latter.

At that time, the usual route of vessels bound to America, was to run down on the other side of the
Atlantic towards the Cape de VerdeS, 3ηά until they got the N. E. tradeS, 3ηά with them steer for America.
This was the route taken by Columbus3 this route brought them upon the coast of the Southern StateS, where
their first landfall was generally made. Then steering to the northward, they drifted along with the Gulf
Stream until they made the Capes of the Delaware, or other headlands to the North.

If now, as it osten happened in the winter season, they were driven off the coast by snow storms and
westerly gales—instead of running off into the Gulf Stream, as vessels now dc, to thaw themselveS, they stood
back to Charleston‚ or the West IndieS, where they would spend the winter, and wait until the spring before
making another attempt to enter the northern portS.

It should be borne in mind that vessels then were not the sea boats or the sailers they now are. I have
in my collection, the Log-book of a West India trader in 1740. Her average rate of sailing per log, was
about two miles the hour. This Log was copied in the 3d edition of this work. It is instructive.

At that time, the instruments of navigation were rude, chronometers were unknown, and lunars were imprac-
ticable, and it was no uncommon thingfor vessels in those dayS,when crossing the Atlantic, to be out of their reckon·

ing 50, 60, and even 100. And when it was announced that a vessel might know by consulting the water

thermometer, when she crossed the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream, and again when she crossed the western
edge, navigators likened the discovery to the drawing of blue 3ηά red streaks in the water, by which, when
the mariner crossed them he might know his longitude.

The merchants of Providence, R. 1., Dr. Faanxnm being in London, sent a petition to the Lords of the

Treasury, asking that the Falmouth packets might run to Providence instead of to Boston3 they maintained
that though Boston and Falmouth were between Providence and London, yet that practically the two former
were further apart, than the two latter, for it was shown in the memorial, that the average passage of the Lon·
don traders to Providence, was fourteen days less than the average by the packet line from Falmouth to Boston.

Dr. Fanum, on being questioned as to this fact, consulted Captain Folger, an old New England Cap·
tain, who had been a whaler, and who informed the Doctor that the London traders to Providence were com-
manded sor the most part by New England fishermen, who knew how to avoid the „Gulf Stream, while the
Falmouth packets were commanded by Englishmen who knew nothing about it.

These two drew a chart, which was published at the Tower, and the limits of the Gulf Stream, as laid down

there by that Yankee whaler, have been preserved upon our charts till within a few yearS.
