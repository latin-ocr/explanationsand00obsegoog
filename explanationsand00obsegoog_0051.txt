During the course of these investigations, facts», in many instance8‚ have been elicited to confirm what
philosophers already knew, and had proclaimed touching the winds and currents of the sea. In other
instances, facts and circumstances have been revealed, which may be regarded as new, and in some cases as
amounting to valuable if not important discoverieS.

As all the results derived from these ChartS‚ whether in confirmation os what was already suspected, or in
evidence os increasing knowledge as to the laws of nature, have been obtained by a new 3ηά independent
system of research, they, or the most striking of them, deserve to be enumerated, in order that the importance
of the undertaking may be better appreciated by those upon whom I have called for help and co·operation.

These are some os them ι

lst. The discovery of a new and better route hence to the equator.

2d. A system of southwardly monsoons in the equatorial regions os the Atlantic ocean.

3d. Ditto off the west coast of America in the Pacific.

4th. The vibratory motion os the trade wind zoneS, with their belts os calms. ,

5th. The limits of these have been determined, 3ηά the parallels between which those limits are to be
found for any mouth, pointed out to the mariner.

6th. The fact has also been made clear, and brought within the compass of demonstration, that the S. E.

trade winds are stronger than the N. E.; that they cover a broader belt on the ocean, and keep in motion
a greater volume os atmosphere 3 that at a mean in the Atlantic, the breadth of the band of trade winds is
about 220 for the N. E. 3 3ηά 290 for the S. Ε.

7th. That in the general system of atmospherical circulatim, the prevailing winds of the southern are
stronger than the prevailing winds of the northern hemisphere.

8th. That the mean temperature of the northern is higher than that of the southern hemisphere.

9th. That the greatest density or specific gravity os the surface waters os the Atlantic ocean, is near the
parallels of 170 North 3ηά of 150 South.

lOth. The causes os the rainy and dry seasons‚ 3ηά the means of telling wherever on the Earth’s surface,
the seasons are so divided by nature. ι

llth. The parts of the ocean in which sperm and right whales most resort have'been discovered and
pointed out.

l2th. The interesting fact in the natural history of this animal has been brought to light, viz ε that the
species known to fishermen as the right whale cannot cross the torrid zone. ’

13th. And that there is a species of whale peculiar to the Arctic ocean3 and probably another to the
coast of Calisornia. ἑ

14th. That in certain parts of the Indian ocean, the waters are warmer than in any other sea.

15th. That there is a cold current along the coast of China.

16th. And that there are many highly interesting and beautiful anomalies touching the Gulf Stream, the
cold and warm currents of the sea, 3ηά the distribution of heat over the surface of the land and water, sor an

account of which, 1 refer to the Charts themselves,
