S. Ε. trade takes up more moisture because it sweeps over a broader belt of ocean3 and, sweeping over a
broader belt, it remains longer in contact with the evaporating surface3 and consequently it may be supposed,
it brings more moisture to the belt of equatoiial calms whence the ascent takes place.

A large portion of this moisture is deposited in the equatorial calms, which we know is a region of con·
stant precipitatione But where is the rest precipitated—in the northern or southern hemisphere? In the former,
1 suppose; because the rivers and the rain-gauge, as far as it has been observed, tell us that the total amount
of precipitation in the northern, is'greater than that in the southern hemisphere3 indeed, it is not necessary
to consult the rath-gange to learn this3 the rivers themselves are sufficient rain-ganges for this purpose3 for we
have only to consider the volume os water annually discharged into the ocean by northern rivers, to see in it
an expression for an amount by which thesotal precipitation is in excess of the total evaporation which takes
place in the whole extent of valleys drained by such riverS. Search the southern hemisphere sor a like quan-
tity, and the search will be in vain.

Seeing, moreover, that the southern hemisphere has more water and less land than the northern3 that it
has less rain and fewer riverS, it seems as though, in likening the atmosphere to an immense machine, we
might call the southern seas the boiler, and the northern continent, the condenser for the mighty engine.

There is, perhaps, another point upon which an argument, not altogether without plausibility, may be
turned in favor of this hypothesis.

The grounds for this argument are drawn from probability, and the argument itself rests pn the degree os

belief and saith we have in the perfectiori os terrestrial adaptations.
To state the argument in this point of view, we must consider the atmosphere, not only as a great con·

densing machine, but as an immense sewer, in which vast quantities of corrupt animal and vegetable matter
are continually being cast for re-elaboration, purification, re·arrangement, and re·adaptation to the purposes of

the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
Notwithstanding the quantity of matter that the plants and animala of the earth are continually taking from

the atmosphere on the one hand, and are as continually casting into it on the other, so admirably arranged is
it, and so perfect its system os circulation, now across the seaS, now through foresta, and again over deserts,

buming sanda, and frozen heights, that its proportions are never destroyed.
In this system of purification and preservation, we know that vegetation in active growth has much to do.
Now, then, if we consider that the N. Ε. trade windS, when they arrive at the equator, ascend, return to
the North in the upper regions until they reach the parallel of 300 or 400 North, where they descend to the
υ surface, and are known 33 what the Germana style the S. W. passage winds; if, 1 say, this be the course of

atmospherical circulatim, we shall see that the air in our winter time, when vegetation is'asleep with us, would

probably not be exposed to the process necessary sor its purification ς and finally, if such were the system of
