In that trade, clipper ships will be able to set up a strong opposition to steamers3 for if we take into ac-
count the increased distance that 8133111318, touching at the Cape of Good Hope and one 01 two other places
for 0031, will have to go, together with the delays incident thereto, we shall sce that our clipper ships have
not much cause to sear that steamers will ever run them off the water in the Australian trade.

As it has been already remarked‚ Australia and the United 813138 313 antipoda13 they are about 12000
geographical miles apart, and it is about as near to come via Cape Horn as it is to go via the Cape of Good
Hope. The steamers therefore on their return via the Cape of Good Hope have head winds to contend with
for that much of the way, whereas the canvass trader retur ning by Cape Horn has fair winds 10 go, and fair
winds to come from the Cape of Good Hope all the way 3381 even to Cape Horn.

The passage from Cape Horn to the United States is sometimes made froin forty to sorty-five days; and Cape
Horn may be reached under canvass from Port Philip with these westcrly winds and long swells and by keep·
ing well to the south in twenty ·or twenty-five days·

ern Ocean, especially on the polar side of 490 or 5003 8.

The opinion may be rash, or th'e expression of it may seem like a boast, but be what it may, 1 here
venture the prediction that the round voyage from the United 813138 10 Ρο11 Philip or Hobarton and· home
again, can 113 made and will be made under canvass by the route here laid down, in 125 or 130 days; or less.

Nay, Ι go further, for so great 18 the confidence Ι have in the propelling power of these westwardly Trades
of the extra-tropical South—and venture the opinion that a voyage of circumnavigation 0311 113 accomplished

by this route in less time than the passage 1138 ever yet been made by clipper ships from New York or Bo‘ston
to San Francisco.
