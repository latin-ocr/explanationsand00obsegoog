‘rm-2 cauronma passaer.. 453

The shortest from the Line tQSan Francisco was 16 dayS, by the “ Mary Reed,’' that crossed in 11403 3ηά
26 by the “ Hope,” that crossed in 1150. .

The longest passage from Valparaiso to the Line was hythe “Mary Reed’' on the same trip-before
quoted as one of the shortest from the Line. She had 29 days from Valparaiso to the Line, in 11403 and 16
days thence to San FranciscO.

The longest passage from the Line to California by any one of these 26 vessels from Valparaiso was 50
days by the “ Florence,’' which crossed in 1060.

The best route therefore, in August, as well as in J uly, September, 3ηά October, would seem to require

the Line to be crossed well out to the west, to avoid the influence of the arid plains of New Mexico upon the
N. E. trades, On the other hand good passages are frequently made in the Summer and Fall months by cross-
ing near 1000—-0n the other extreme3 for by so domg, vessels stand a chance of getting the south westerly winds
which prevail between 1050 and Ceutral America at this season. A more westerly crossing, however, will be
found the best in the long run.

In August the S. E. trades will often be carried as far as 100 Ν. ; 3ηά the N. E. trades will sre-
quently not be found until after crossing 150 N.

In September the winds will be found very much as they are in August3 the shortest passage from the
United States to the Line, in September, of which there are seven, was made by the “ Witch of the Wave„ in
90 dayS. She crossed in 1140, 3ηά had 25 days thence to San Francisco. The “ Carioca” had 116 days from
Philadelphia to 1010 W., on the Equator, 3ηά 41 thence to San FranciscO.

For the October crossingS, we have the tracks of eleven vesseIS, all the way from the “ State8.'' Of these,
seven crossed between 1100 3ηά 1150 with an average of 99 days to the Line, 3ηά 25 days thence to San
F rancisco. The shortest of these eleven to the line were the clippers ‘⁴ Celestial,'’ and “ Sovereign of the
SeaS,'' each of 83 days to it, the former in 1180 West, 3ηά 21 days thence to California 3 the latter having crossed
in 1200‚with 20 days thence. The shortest from the Line to San Francisco was 19 days by the “Ty‘phoon,'' which
crossed 'at 1150, 87 days from New York. The next shortest were the “Sovereign of the Seas'' 3ηά the “Raven,''
clipperS, each of 20 dayS.' The Rav en crossed in 1120, 85 days srom New York. The next best to these,
was the “ Thomas PerkinS,’' which crossed at 1110, 100 days out, and had 26 days thence into port. 'Th e
clipper “ Eagle'‘ comes next in this mouth of good passageS, 101 days out; she crossed the Line in 1150 W. ‚

with 28 days thence to San FranciscO.
The best crossing, therefore, for October, seems from these tracks and other statistics, to bcanywhere

to the west of 1050 W., say between 1100 3ηά 1150 W.
In December the best passage to the Line, was by the clipper ‘⁴ Comet,'' with 88 days from New York.

She crossed itxin 1170 W., 3ηά had 16 days thence to San Francisco.
The clipper “ White Squall,” with 59 days from Rio, crossed in 1180 3ηά had 14 days,—the quickest run

yet made-—from the Line to San FranciscO.

From all tlgezinformation before me, Ι am now disposed to recommend an equatorial crossing very near long.
