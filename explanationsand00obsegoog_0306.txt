The S perm whale is remarkable for yielding the unctuous substance whence comes its name ; and it is also
remarkable for producing ambergris ; t‘he bowels of a sperm whale forming the only situation where this singular
fragrant substance is generated. Whether its existence is a cause of, or the effect of disease, is not yet
known3 it rarely occurS, not perhaps in one whale out of a thousand.

They seem to be more migratory in their habits than other whaleS, occurring in every parallel of latitude
between the two polar seaS, down to an equatorial one t. though generally preferring the deep blue sea that in·
dicates unfathomable depths. ι ’ ·

As they are thus widely scattered‚ they are searched for in almost every sea, however remote, and hence
it often occurs in voyages os 3 or 4 years duration, that ships before completing their cargoeS, entirely circum·
navigate the Globe. They are occasionally seen in the Atlantic and Indian oceans ; but are found in greater
abundance in the Pacific, where they are seen at times in favorite spots», scattered over the whole extent of
this great sea. When half a century agn, our ships first ventured into the Pacific in quest of sperm whales,
the coasts of Chili and Peru abounded in them ; and our hardy pioneers in this daring occupation were there
enabled to fill their shipS, without the necessity of penetrating farther. But the whaling fleet increased ex-
tensively; the persecuted whales were in a measure killed and driven from their haunts ; so that later voyagers
to insure succeSS, have been compelled to push their adventures into still farther and comparatively unknown
seaS. One unexplored track after another has been traversed, until it may now be said that from'Cluli to
New Holland, from California to the Japan Isles, and China sea, with the whole intermediate space—in ‘a
word, over a square expanse comprehending above eighty degrees of latitude, and more than one hundred of
longitude, there is scarce a spot of any extent but what has been furrowed by the keels of a whaler, and been
a place of privation to her enduring crew.

Zoologists have classed these animaIS, as well as the sporting tribe, among fisheS, distinguishing them
by cetaceous order, comprehending a variety of specieS. But on an examination of their structure and func·
tionS, the impropriety of this classificatl'on is manifest; and the inspector is at once convinced of their being
far removed, or in fact wholly distinct from any species of fish. They have many analogies with the larger
land animals, having in common with them, warm, red blood flowing through the system, though a certain
modern philosopher has asserted to the contrary: Robert D. Owen, in one of his published letters while in
America, skeptically comparing his situation in a stage coach to that of Jonah in the whale’s belly, asserted
that the whale was a “ cold blooded animal.'’

They have a heart, with auricles and ventricles through which this fluid is propelled3 they have lungS,
together with all the functions for breathing atmospheric air, and they can only suspend this breathing for an
hour or two at a time. Being entire tenants of the deep, and having organs for propelling them through it,
are the only fish-like qualities they possess. They seem to form a sort of intermediate and connecting link
between absolute beasts, and their more near submarine neighbors.

Itis highly creditable to the spirited and enterprising individuals, who have put forth their capital in ships,

destined to traverse the deep in quest of these oily monsters, that they have become so numerous as to form
