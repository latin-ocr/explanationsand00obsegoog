Not one of them was found, nor any indication of their existence ; on the contrary, every evidence to disprove
it. Our various tracks over and about their reported positione, covering the extent of ΗΓ degrees of longitude
and 40 miles of latitude, with the many and deep soundings, from 100 to 800 fathoms, without getting
bottom‚ will be sound sufficient, I trust, to satisfy navigators that they have no existence—or at least,.that
those parts of the ocean in which they have been reported to exist, are free from all dangers. To the first
three mentioned we gave the most thorough search: to Ashton Rook, six days time; to the False Bermudas
eight days ; to Nye’s Rock, likewise ‚eight days, All our tracks were by daylight, as the schooner was always
hove to at night, while engaged in these exploratione.. A slight discoloration of water was noticed in the
region assigned to Mary’s Book, but no soundings could be got with 500 fathomS. This rock had been
previously searched for with like result8‚ by the U. S. Exploring Expedition, Captain Wilkes3 and by H. M.
S. Levia, Captain Bartholomew. Ashton Rock is placed in a most frequented part of the ocean3 there is not
a day that some vessel does not pass in the vicinity, and nothing has been seen of it since the first and only
report of it in the year 1824. This fact alone should disprove it, independent of our search. Ι find Mr.
Blunt has erased it from·his Chart of the North Atlantic, as also the False BermudaS, Vankeulen’s Vigia,
Steen Ground and Mary’s Rock. There are sufficient real dangers in the Atlantic ; these imaginary ones should
not disfigure the charts3 they only serve to harrass navigatorS, turn vessels from their routeS, aud thus injure
commerce. The reports of them by merchant vesseIS, which seldom take time to examine the appearance of
such dangers‚ can be readily explained. Floating wreckS, large treeS, carcasses of whales‚ &c., presenting
all the appearance of reefS, have deceived experienced seamen.

Though we did so much less in deep soundings in the Atlantic, than expected, owing to the rough weather‚
bad state of the vessel and loss of so much wire, in the first experiment, nevertheless the proving the ocean
to have a depth of more than 5,7oo fathomS, (34‚2oo feet, or more than six statute miles‚) as was satisfactorily
done in this first trial, is alone of much interest and importance. This vast depth, greater than the elevation
of any mountain above the surface‚ and the greatest depth of the ocean ever yet measured, was reached, without
finding bottom‚ in latitude 310 59¹ N., longitude 580 43' W.‚ on November 15th, 1849. The wire broke at
, this length, 5‚700 fathomS‚ at the reel, and this large portion of our supply was thus so early lost. It pre-
served the exact plumb line thoughout the sounding3 there was a steady, uniform increase of weight and-
tensi0n3 no check whatever any instant of its descent,—which proved that it could not have touched bottom

before the break! It had been very carefully measured and marked, so that the ocean here is deeper than

 

⁸ The lead used was but 10 lbs. weight, with a Stellwagen cone fitted to it. Nothing else was attached to the wire but a small
instrument (weighing about 6 lbn.) invented by yourself, for indicating the depth reached ι 1 had tested this several times to considerable

aad gn account ot‘ them. We had on board 14,300 sathoms os wire, weighing 3,0251bs.‚ all ot‘ the best English ateel, of five different nizea,
