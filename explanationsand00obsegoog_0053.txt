the Carribbean sea in the deepest parts is nearly three mile8‚ is no more; that the North Atlantic is more than 6
miles3 the South at least three3 and the Gulf stream in the Florida pass, 500 fathoms deep.

llth. Agencies have been revealed which suggest the conjecture that at the head of the Red sea near the
isthmus of Suez, the waters are lower, saltier and heavier, than they are near its mouth. That at its head there
is a winter and a summer level, and that there is a strong under current from it into the Indian ocean.

leth. That the same whale is found in Behring’s StraitS, and Baffin's Bay, and the fact is proved that this
fish cannot get from the one place to the other except through the Arctic Oqean.

Ι do not wish to be understood as claiming this catalogue of phenomena as actual results already derived
from the investigations os Log Books; nor do I intend by this enumeration of them to commit myself with re-
gard to them further than I have done in the body of this work. Whether they be regarded as questions for
further research, as probabilntieS, as actual discoverieS‚ or as confirmations of known truthS, Ihave enumerated
them for the purpose of showing those who are laboring in connection with this work, that the-field is both rich
and wide ; that good use is made of the materials which are furnished ; that the plan of treating these materials

is a good one, because, resting on an independent and separate system of observationS, the manner of discussion

is such as to confirm almost all that was known befo're with regard to the winds and currents of the sea, and
1 have enumerated them for the purpose also os showing that though much that is valuable and important has
been done, much that is inviting remains yeit to be done.

Neither do I mean to embarrass this beautiful system of investigations by implying that all these indica-
tions are to be established, and all these questions to be answered in the affirmative. But inasmuch as they are
indications and questions which mark the progress of the ChartS, and which the Charts themselves have re-
vealed or suggested, Ι expect the Charts will throw more light upon most of them, and enable us to give some

conclusive answer, pro or con, with regard to them.

In a system of research such as this is, questions will arise, and there are many such which are continu·
ally pressing themselves upon the philosopher, to which a satisfactory answer, whether in the negative or the
affirmative is equally desirable, and will be equally conducive to the great end in view, viz: progress in the
collection of physical facts and advancement in studying the laws os nature. Such is the character of many of
’ the questions which these Charts move us to propound.

For the materials from which these results have been obtained, or are promised, I am mainly indebted
to the voluntary co·operati0n of American shipmasters and owners; for the results themselves, I am in-
debted, first to the countenance which the Navy Department and the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and
Hydrography have extended to the work3 and next to the fidelity and zeal with which those of my brother
officers of the Navy, who, from time to time, have been engaged with me upon it, have carried out my views
with regard to the manner of conducting it.

Ever since Log books have been kept at sea, and preserved in old sea chests and garrets on shore, the

materials sor such a system of investigations as this is, have existed. But the labor of collecting from such

recordS, the remarks on the wind and weather, and of collecting the experience of each one in relation theret0,
