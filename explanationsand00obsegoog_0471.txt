as coming—going the ,distance to be sailed on account of detour for the sake of -winds, is about 7‚500 miles.
returning, that is, coming this way by the eastern· route, the distance is eight or nine hundred miles greater. With
the exception of the N. E. trades on the passage from New South wales, or Victoria to California, the

winds are fair or may conveniently be made fair both ways· A N. Ε course good can be made through the

S. E. trades3 and a N. N. W. course on the average through the N. Ε. trades. But these courses will not‘

give easting enough for the California bound trader, and it therefore becomes a question for him to decide
whether he will make up his easting in the variables south of S. E. trade8‚ or in the variables N. of the N.
E. tradeS‚ for in both of those systems of variables westwardly winds prevail.

In coming out of the Victoria porte, go south of Van Dieman’s Land,·or through Bass’ straits, as you have

the winds and find it expedient.

Being south of Van Dieman’s Land makes it convenient to pass south of New Zealand, if the wind be
fair, as in the majority of cases it will be. Having passed south of New Zealand, steer sor the parallelos
4Οο S., at or near its intersection with the meridian of 1500W., thence for the equator between 1200 and 1300
W„ crossing by a. north course, both the horse latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and the equatorial dol
drumm 'then run through the N. E. trades as best you may, keeping a “ rap full ” and running up into the
variables beyond th'e horse latitude calms of the Northern Hemisphere‚ if need be, to complete your easting
and make your port.

1f the winds be 'not fair for passing south of New Zealand, try Cook's straits in preference to passing to
the north of New Ulster.

If you pass through Cook’s straitS, then stick her well to the eastward and take the eastern passage.
On this passage you should run down your eastin g pretty well before you get far enough north to be bothered
by the baffling winds of the horse latitudes south. If these come as low down as 380 or 400 S., stand north
the moment you feel them till you get the S. Ε. trades; then cross these and the N. Ε. trades, both as
obliquely to the eastward as they will permit, with fore-topmast studding·sails set.

On this passage you will have finally to ru'n down your easting, when you get into the variables‚ beyond
the N. E. trades, and of course you will aim to reach the parallelos 380 or 400 N.‚ or even a higher one
north, to do this. How sar you will go north depends somewhat upon the distance you may be west of Cali-
fornia when you lose the N. E. trades. If you be only a degree or two from the land, you will steer straight
for your port without caring to get to the northward of it; but if you be ten or twenty degrees to the west
of it, or even farther, then of course ther distance to be run makes it an object to turn out of your way and
go north in searchof good winds.

Therefore the choice of routes on this voyage resolves itself into the answer to this question ε Is it best
to make easting between the parallels of 4Οο and 500 S., or about the parallel of 4Οο N.? If the former, then
the eastern route is the route 3 if the latter, then the preference should be given to the western route.

I give preference to the eastern route especially and decidedly when the winde at starting are favorable sor

the εαεῖὸἓοιιτεε. 1 have no doubt but that, as a general mle, the winda by the eastern route, both varinblee
