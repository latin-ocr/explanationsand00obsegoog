6,700fathoms, can be relied upon as accurate. This great sounding is within 32 miles of the assigned position
of the rockS, called the False BermudaS, for which we were then in search, which fact alone should go far to
disprove them. We had three choice chronometerS, two of which performed with rare excellence throughout
the cruise, and being a beautiful, clear day, a number of sets of observations were taken in the morning, noon,·
and asternoon, so that the position was determined with the nicest accuracy. It proved the finest possible day
for this work, the sea so smooth and hardly a breath of wind. Though we found by trial in the morning a
slight surface drist, setting to W. S, W.‚ there was no change of position during the sounding, as proved by

the observations ; the great weight and extent of the wire, penetrating to such profound depths‚ seemed to

serve as an anchor to keep the little schooner steady.

In all our subsequent work under this head, 1 found the heave of the sea, however slight, was the great
difficulty—the hsting of the stern in the pitching motion caustng such an immense increase of strainupon the
wire, breaking ‘it upon almost every occasion on reaching about 2,000 fathomS. It is only under the most fa-
vorable circumstanceS, when the sea is very unusually smooth, that this mode of measuring its vast central
depths can succeed.

The next subject to which 1 would refer, is our investigations of the under currente of the ocean. 1
regret we had so few opportunities for these very interesting experiments ; but enough has been done to seem to
warrant the conclusion, that these under-currents are generally stronger, setting in various different directionS,
than those of the surface. 1 am well aware that there is no mode of testing their exact velocity; but that prac-
tised by myself, which I will describe, was certainly all-sufficient to show their relative velocity. There may
be none so rapid as that mighty oceanic river, the (ἔπιθ’ Stream: unfortunately, the weather prevented our
making these investigations in that interesting region; but in the various parts of the Atlantic in which we
succeeded in these experiments, on only two occasions did we find the under-current of less velocity than that

running in a different direction above it. The following is the mode practised in testing them:

 

Nos. 5, 7, 8, 10, and 13 (Birmingham ganges.) Every partwas tested to bear at least one-third more than the weight which it was calcu·
lated to sustain. “

An extent os 7,000 fathorns of this, weighing 1‚8001bs. (the remaining 7300 fathoms, composed of the smaller sizes, Nos. 10 and
13, being stowed away as spare wire‚) carefully measured and marked with small copper labels, was linked into one piece‚ and wound
upon an iron cylinder, 3 feet in length and 20 inches in diameter,—the largest-saed wire being wound first, ao as to be uppermost in
munding. Two swivels were placed near the lead, and one at each thousand fathoms, to meet the danger of twisting off by the probable
rotary motion in reeling up. The cylinder with the wire was fitted to a strong wooden frame, and machinery attached—fly·wheel and
piniona, to give powerin reeling up. Four men at the cranks could reel up with ease, with the whole weight of wire out. Iron friction
banda, which proved of indispensable importance‚ were connected to regulate the rate of the wire in running off the recl. One man with
hia hand upon the lever of one of these friction bands could preserve a uniform, ease velocity, checking or stopping the wire as required.
The whole apparatus could be taken apam and stowed away in pieces (being so large and massive, this was indispensable in so small a
venel as the Taney.) When wanted for use, the frame was put together, and secured to the declr by iron clamps and bolts, near
amidahips, the reel hoisted up from below, and shipped in its place ς a fitia-lenden· was secured to the tafl'rail, being a thick oak plank, rigged
out five feet over the stetu, having an iron pulley, 18 inches diameter, fitted in its outer end, and two sheet iron fenders 33 feet long. of
nemi-circular shape, fitted under it, to guard the wire from getting a short nip in the drifting of the vessel. The wire was led ast, from
the reel, over the pulley which traversed freely in the sairleader‚ and passed between these senders into the water.

The time occupied in the descent of the 5:100 sallionis, at the moderate rate it was allowed to go off the reel‚ using the friction banda,
was exactly 1} hours. 1 found in the subsequent aounffingn, that two or three men could reel up 1‚ooo sathoms in 23 hours, taking time

to rub dry and oil itin passing to the reel, to guard against rust. J C w
