A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM ΟΡ OBSERVATIONS. 29

It will be observed that the meteorologists and Government of Great Britain have already taken steps for
enlisting a large corps os laborers in the meteorological field, and that the American proposition is offered only
as an amendment theret0.

To make the system complete, it appeared necessary to spread it out over the sea, as well as the land3
’ and to secure the requisite concert of action among observers in all countries, it was thought advisable topropose a
conference of meteorologists generally, at which the kind and construction of the instruments to be used, the
subjects of observation, the time and method of observing, with the forms for recording and reducingthe observa-
tionS, δια, may be dismissed and arranged ; and at which, also, all the arrangements sor a universal system of
observation, including a series for the sea as well as sor the land, may be made, and the plans for carrying
it out recommended for the approval and adoption of those upon whose co·operation the successful prosecu-
tion of the scheme must rely. Itis proposed that this conference shall be as general as is the field of research ;
and, therefore, it is desired that all those who have it in their power to assist‚ will take part in its proceedings
either by personal representation or written communication, as to them may seem best. ,

The time and place for holding this conference, have not been agreed upon ; but as soon as they are, they
will be made known. In the mean time, communications have been addressed to the diplomatic functionaries
of the various Governments represented near Washington‚ requesting them to bring the subject to the notice of
their GovernmentS. The replies of these gentlemen axe encouragiug3 they give reason to expect that their
Governments will give the proposition a favorable consideration.

After the details of the plan shall have been agreed upon in conference, it is supposed that the parties
therein represented will co·operate in giving effect to the plan, by directing the observations to be made accord-
ing to it, on board public shipS, at military poste, at light-houseS, hospitals and all other government establish-

ments and institutions at which it may be convenient or desirable to institute a series of meteorological

observations
But, as important as such a co·operation on the partos GovernmentS, would be, and as greatly to be
desired as it is, that co·operation would by no means cover the whole ground3 nor would the corps of laborers
thus brought into the field, though every State in Christendom should unite in the scheme, be sufficient to
ἡ gather the harvest that it is proposed to reap.

The plan, though it fully recognizes the value of the aid which Governments can give, by no means over-
looks the importance of that kind of co·operation and aid which is to be derived from the hearty good will os
good men, and from the voluntary co·operation of that powersul corps of Meteorological observers and naviga-
tors who labor in the private walks of lise.

“ Man is a Meteorologist by nature ;'’ andevery one who observes the wind and the weather, and who is in
the habit ofnoting the thermometer and the barometer, is already an observet whose services it is desirable to
secure, and whose labors in the field meteorological, the plan in contemplation proposes to make available. In
like manner ‘⁴ all who go down to the sea in shipS,’' are invited to co·operate: for they, too, are observerS.

That this immense corps of laborers who are already in the field should act in concert and “ pull together‚” is
