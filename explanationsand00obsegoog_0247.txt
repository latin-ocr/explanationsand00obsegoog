These mountains extend from three to five miles up into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds blow almost
perpendicularly against them. Of course, these winds are obstructed by an obstacle, which extends as sar up,
or nearly as far up, as they themselves do 3 and, being thus obstructed in their course, would there not, con-
sequently, be a banking up of air against the AndeS, as there is of water against a rock or other impediment
over which the current of a rapid river has to force its way ? In such caseS, there is a ridge or pile of water
above the obstruction‚ and a depression οι hollow in the water both above and below this ridge.

Herndon's observations on the boiling point of water, have suggested to me the idea of an air-cast mould
of the Andes in the atmosphere3 in other words ε that there is to windward—that is, to the eastward of the
Andes, where the Trade Winds first impinge—an accumulation or ridge of atmosphere, with a valley or
depression on each side of it. -

To illustrate this, 1 have had diagram Β. of Plate XV, drawn, upon the supposition that the average de·
scent of the Amazon from Chasuta, at the head of uninterrupted navigation, down to the sea, is 8 inches to
the mile. Eight inches to the mile is probably too great a descent from the foot of the last rapid in the
Amazon to the sea. But the object of the diagram is not to illustrate the slope of the Amazonian water-shed ;
it is to illustrate the remarkable degree of barometric pressure that has been found near the eastern base of
the CordilleraS. 1 therefore assume the descent of the river to be on the average, very nearly what
Herndon's observations made it to be, after he had passed from under the supposed elevation, or ridge of
the atmosphere. The distance from Chasuta to the sea is, by the windings of the river, about 3,285 mileS.

The dotted line, then, of Fig. B, shows a profile view of Herndon's descent, according to the temperature
of the boiling point3 and the continuous line, his actual descent, upon the supposition that the average
inclination of the river from Chasuta to the sea is as before stated ε 8 inches to the mile.

From N anta, where his boiling point placed him at only 126 feet above the level of the sea, to EgaS, where,
though drifting down the stream all the way, it placed him 1,715 feet above it, the distance is 707 miles, lf
intermediate observations could have been made between these two placeS, he would probably have found that
he had passed from under this supposed air-cast range of mountains long before he reached EgaS.

However, observations sufficient for a full explanation of the phenomena presented by this diagram are want-
ing, and we must deal with those we have, as best we may, hoping by calling attention to the subject upon such
meagoe facts, some other traveller will be provoked into a· thorough and complete series of barometric observa-
tions along the slopes of the Andes.

Lieut. Herndon assumed that at the mouth of the Amazon, the mean height of the barometer would be
30 in., the boiling point 2120. But during a portion of his descent, the belt of the equatorial calms was over the
mouth of the Amazon. All the ships whose Log Books 1 have with records in them, as to the« barometer,
show that it does not stand as high in these calms as it does on either side of them. Dewey’s observations

at Para, confirm this. Therefore Herndon’s heights as determined by the boiling point of water during his
descent os the Amazon, are probably not so great as the standard to which he referred his observations would

make it.
