OF 'ms passam: Ancum) caps nom«. 415

Capt. Young of the Ship “ Venice,” of Philadelphia‚ in his admirably kept abstract, makes also some
judicious remarks upon the subject of the Cape Horn passage.
Capt. Young’s log is deserving of special notice also, sor the very excellent use he makes of the barometer.

His remark that the indications of the barometer will show ,when the navigator entem, and when he quits
the trades, is persectly philosophical.

In the calmS‚ both of Cancer and capricorn, the barometer ought to stand higher—say one-tenth of an
inch‚ (0.1) on the average—than it does either in the “ variables” on the polar side of these besta, or in the
“trades’' on the eqtiatorial side of them.

In the belt of the equatorial calmS‚ it also ought to stand, on the average, a little lower than it does in the

N. Ε. or S. Ε. trades on either side of those calmS.
The close attention which Capt. Young gives his barometer‚ will, as a general mle, enable navigators in
most cases to tell whether they have crossed the calms or the trade wind belm, or not.

See also the log of the “Great Britain‚’' for Capt. Caldwell’s remarks on his barometer during his Cape

Horn passage.
