Certainly no conclusione can be safely drawn from these data, as to the best crossing for either of these two

months.

The passages for March have already been discussed, and it appears from the statistics involved in that
discussion, that the Line, so far as the passage thence to California is concerned, may be crossed with equal
advantage, anywhere between Long. 1000 3ηά Long. 1250 West. From 1100 to 1150 will probably be found
the best crossings for this mouth.

The place of crossing in Marclr, appears to be governed by the winds encountered between Cape Horn
and the region of S. E. trade winds in the Pacific.

Therefore, after doubling Cape Horu in J anuary or February, if the wimls should be free for a N. W. or
a W. N.‘W. course, make the best os them ; aiming to crOSS, if with convenience you may, the parallel os 500
S. between 800 3ηά 90ος of 400 between 9Οο 3ηά 100ος of 300 South, to the West of Long. 1050; so that ὁ

you may catch the S. Ε. trades somewhere between that meridiari, of 1100 West. The meridiari even of 1 150,

will not be too far West for entering ⁴the S. E. trades». But you are not to beat or to jam upon a wind
to make westing in this part of the voyage.

Having taken these winds near these meridianS, your course then will be mostly due North with the wind
quartering.

In March you will occasionally carry the S. Ε. trades several degrees over into the Nor-thern Hemisphere.
When you lose them and get the N. E. trades, keep away with a good rap full aiming never to cross the paral—
lel of 200 North to the East of Long. 1250 West. Unless the winds force you'off, aim to be in shore of the
meridiari os 1300 W. when you lose the N. E. trades.

When you do lose them, is then you have to fight the calms and baffiing winds of the Horse LatitudeS,
make the best of your way on a due North course, till you cross this belt of calms and get into the ,variables
beyond. 1 shall have more to say upon this subject at a subsequent page of this work.

In April, we have the abstracts of two vessels that crossed between 1000 3ηά 1050, with an average of 283
days thence to Calisornia ; of 4 between 1050 and 1100 with an average time of 33} days ; of three between 1100 ,
3ηά 1150, with an average of 26 days; 3ηά of three between 1150 3ηά 1200, with an average also of 26 days
thence to Calisornia. The average of the last three from the United States to California happens to be 12
days less than the average by any other crossing in this mouth.

We have but one vessel direct from the United States to California that crossed between 1000 3ηά 1050.
She is the “ Great Britain,'' a vessel 25 years old and a dull sailer. The other vessel that crossed between
these two meridiam, was the “ Seaman’s Bride.” She had 27 days thence to Calisornia.

The vessels that crossed in April between 1150 3ηά 1200 were the ‘⁸ Isabelita Hyne,” the “ Marie,” and
the “Samuel Russell”—clipper. Therefore considering the insufficiency of data, I would repeat here the
suggestions already-offered concerning the route for crossing the line in March.

In order to make westing in the high latitudes about the parallels of Patagonia, and after doubling Cape

Hom, navigaton are recommended to do that only in case their winds allow it. For it should be borne in
