river basins of equatorial America, and in the vicinity of the Cape de Verd islands ; at Lyons and Genoa 3 in
Malta and the Tyrol; showers os the so·called sirocco dust are known to occur. That celebrated microscopist
has examined, with the utmost care, specimens of this dust3 and in every specimen that has corne to his notice
during the period of sixteen yearS, he has recognised the same organisms, the same forms in them all ; and he
traces the locus os the great majority of thern to the trade wind regions of South America.

Now, if it be true that the trade winds from that part of the world take up there the water which is to be
rained ln the extra· tropical North, the path ascribed to the southeast trades of Africa and America, after they
descend and become the prevailing southwest winds of the northern hemisphere, should pass over a region of
less percipitation, generally, than they would d0‚ if, while performing the office os soutbeast trades, they had
blown over water instead of land. The southeast trade windS, with their load of vapor, whether great or
small, take, after ascending in the equatorial calms, a northeastly direction: they continue to flow in the
upper regions of the air, inq that direction, until they cross the tropic of Cancer. The places of least rain,
then, between this tropic and the pole, should be precisely those places which depend 'for their rains upon the
vapor which the winds that blow over southeast trade wind Africa and America convey.

Now, if we could trace the path of these winds through the extra-tropical regions of the northern hemisphere,
we should be able to identify it by the footprints of the clouds; for the path' of the winds which depend for x
their moisture upon such sources of supply as the dry land of Central South America and Africa, cannot lie
through a country that is watered well.

It is a remarkable coincidence, at least, that the countries in the extra-tropical regions of the North, that
are situated to the northeast of the southeast trad'e winds of South Africa and America ; that the countries with
us, over which theory makes these winds to blow, include all the great deserts of Asia, and the districts of
least precipitation in Europe?

The hyetographic map of Europe, in Johnston’s beautiful Physical Atlas, places the region of least pre-
cipitation between these two lines· See Plate IV.

It would seem that nature, as if to reclaim this “ lee” land from the desert, had stationed by the wayside

of these winds a succession of inland seas to serve them as relayS, for supplying with moisture· this
thirsty air. There is the Mediterranean sea, the Caspian sea, and the sea of Aral, all of which are situated .

exactly in this direction3 as though these sheets of water were designed, in the grand system of aqueous

 

⁸ Let any one take a rnap of Mercator's projection, and on it draw lines from the tropic of Cancer towards the North, to represent
the probable route and direction which the trade winde os the two southern continents take, in their general channels of circulation over
the northern continents. The country between these two lines is the country which, in the general system os atmospherical circulation,

lies under the lee of southeast trade wind Africa and America. And to see where this country is, we have first to ascertain where those
tvo points on the equator are, between which the southeast trade winde crosa, after having traversed the greatest extent of land sursace in

South Amos-ica ; and then from these point to project lines in the direction which these winds are supposed to take, after rising up in the
equatorial ealms. These two points will be, one near the mouth of the Amazon, the other not sar from the Gallapagos islands ε the part
os the equator between them is the part crossed by the southeast trades, aster having traversed the greatest extent of land from whose
sui-face the supplies os moisture are most scanty. A line from the Gallapagos through Florence in Italy, another from the mouth of the
Amazon through Aleppo in Holy Laud, (Plate tv) would, after passing the tropic os Cancer, mark upon the sut-face os the earth the route
of these windo ε this is that “lee country,” which, is such be the system ofatmospherical circulation, ought to be scantily supplied with retius.
