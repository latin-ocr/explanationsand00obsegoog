will let them, to cross 250 South in about 35ο W. At any rate, as far off from the land 33, with a· go‘od clean
rapfull‚ they can without going to the East of 330 or 340.

After passing the parallel of Cape Frio‚ they should make the best of their way Scuth, aiming always to
pass inside of the Falkland lslands, and if wind and daylight serve, through the straits of La Maire.

The reason sor this recommendation is this τ After crossing the parallel of 'I'ierra del Fuego, the diffi-
culty is to get to the westward. Therefore it is better to make westing on this side, when it is practicable and
where the weather is mild, than to put it off for the stormy latitudes, where it is more difficult.

Captain Smyley, who has been engaged sor many years in the seal fishery of the South Seas, has fur·
nished me with some remarks and sailing directions in relation to this part of the ocean, so also have Capt.

Bryson and others 3 navigators may find these remarks useful 3 I therefore copy them.

From captain Leslie Bryson <ff the Brig “ Daniel'’ to murenam M. F. Maury.

“ In compliance with your published request,1 avail myself of the earliest opportunity to forward to you
an abstract journal of the ‘⁴ Brig Daniel,” formerly the United States Bomb brig Hecla, kept by me on her
voyage from New York to Calisornia, which is but a poor tribute sor the manifest advantage and valuable

knowledge, imparted by the aid of your truly usefnl and ingenious system, which I regard as one of the most

valuable inventione of the age, and doubtless will yet lead to results, sar beyond its present apparent purpose,

to speed the voyage.
Notieing your intimation to West India traders sor further'data, to complete your Wind and Current Chart

'of the “West Indies,'' I have written a friend to send you my private journals, embracing a period of about
six yearS, commencing May, 1838. These journals were kept ser the purpose of facilitating a practical
knowledge of winds‚ δια, for which 1 thirsted, without the means of obtaining any reliable information,except
the divers accounts furnished by casual observers, which like the various sailing directions for Cape Horn,
serve rather to distractthe mind than to assist the judgment. 1 was in the constant habit for several years of
referring to these journals with the sole view of obtaining the very information that your charts so plainly and
beautifully illustrate. My personal observation‚ therefore, confirms me in the truth of your system. Having
been kept solely for private use, you will find many remarks in those journals quite irrelevant to your purpose,
nevertheless in your hands, 1 trust they will be acceptable. The temperature of the air and water were only
noted in approaehing and departing from our coast. At different times 1 have found a cold place in the centre
of the Gulf bearing about S. E. by S. from “ Montauk.” Ido not know whether the remark is noted in my
journaIS, but 1 am certain of the fact.

The currents may not always have been regularly noted, except when unusually strong. In reference to

my present passage, 1 would state that I followed your directions, as near as winds would permit. Al-

though the vessel was deep, and sailed heavy, 1 have reason to think our passage was thus materially

shortened.
