310 fair, as vessels that are bound further North, as to Calit'ornisrfor example. *Let these last make westing
whenever they can, without making southing 3130. They cannot well cross the parallel of 500 S.‚ too sar

VVest, on their way to California3 provided Ahey keep to the East of 1000 or 1100.

From Cape Horu, ValparaiSO, and Callao, to the Line in the Pacific‚ it is generally thought to be all plain
sailing. The only charge which it would seem necessary to give to navigators thither bound, is that they
keep well off from the land, in order to be sure of better windS. Those from Cape Horn should 31111 10
enter the S. E. trade wind region of the Pacific as far 10 1110 West, provided they keep this side of 115⁰ or
1200, 33 they well can, without fighting head windS‚ to make westing, or without turning too much from the
direct course when the winds are fair. But when winds are dead ahead, stand off to the Westward, especially
if you be South of the trade wind region. Having crossed the parallel of 350 S.‚ and taken the tradeS‚ the
navigator, with the wind quartering and all sails drawtng, should now make the best of his way to the

equator‚ aiming to cross it between 1050 and 1250, according to the season of the year, and the directions

hereinafter given.

Between the equator and 100 01 120 Ν., according to the season of the year, the California bound naxi-
33101 may expect to lose the S. E. and to get the N. E. trade windS.

He will find these last nearest the equator in January‚ February and March3 but in July, August and Sep·
tember‚ he will sometimes find himself to the North of the parallel of 150 Ν., before he gets fairly into the N.
E. trades, And sometimeS, especially in summer and sall, he will not get them at all, unless he keeps well out
to the XVest. Having them, he should steer a good rap full atleast, aiming of course to cross the parallel of 200
Ν., 111 about 1250 W. , or rather not to the east of that, particularly from June to November. His course aster

crossing 200 Ν., 13 necessarily to the northward and westward until he loses the N. E. tradeS. He should
31111 10 reach the latitude of his port without going to the west of 1300 W., if he can help it, or approaching
1103101· than 250 01 300 1111103 10 1110 131111 1111111 110 passes out of 'the belt of the Ν. Ε. 1131103 and gets into the
variable8‚ the prcvailing direction of which is westerly. ο
“ Where shall we take the S. E. and lose the N. E. trades 011 1110 passage to California ?’' is an important
question sor the navigator to have answered, who is striring sor a short passage on the west coast of South

America. From the parallel of Cape Horn up to the belt of light winds and calms through which you generally.

pass before getting· into the S. Ε. 1131103, 1110 prevailing winds are westwardly windS, having northing more
frequently than southing in them.
