111333, 3313 13 motion 1113 waters of all the southern mouths of our 3333, and propagates to our shores long
after ‘their original force 1133 been impaired, 1113 effecta of 1113 derangement of 1113 equilibrium 01 11131 3331131
reservoir from which alone our tides are derived.’'

Taking 1113 impulse received in the great South Sea cradle‚ the tidal wave commences its flow towards the
North. 113 march and its progress are thus sketched in the physical Atlas of Professor Alexander Keith
J ohnston:

“ Commencing with the new or full Moon,let us take the spring tides, or largest tides formed hythe
coincidence of the actions of Sun and Moon. Let us conceive that this joint action has taken effect on the

waters os 1113 Α31313113 03333-11131 1113 13311331133, 13 conjunction or opposition‚ have passed dver the mass
of waters lying east from Van Dieman's Land, New Zealand‚ and the South Pole, and have communicated to

them motion in 1113 direction of the resultant sorceS, we 311311 manifestly have 3 mass elevated and moving to

1113 North and West, following the 111131113τί33. The motion thus communicated to this mass of water has

raised 3 large mass, or moving ridge os water which cannot expend its forces acquired but by pushing before
it other masses of water and raising them in a wave to which-all its 10133 13 finally imparted. In this way,
the wave originally generated‚ travels northward and westward‚ long after the bodies generating it have ceased
ι10 331 on the first mass of water. The wave generated during the transit of the Sun 3311 Μο03 03 Monday
morning, and producing high water on the coast of Van Dieman’s Laud at twelve, has by noon nearly reached
‘the point of the Peninsula of Hindostan‚ and at one, asternoon, is at the Cape of Good Hope. Here it
enters the Atlantic‚ 3311 1131311133 301111113ῐά3, brings high water at the same 11031310 the western coasts of
Africa and the eastern shores of America.

“ All these seas, save the Antarctic, 11313 1113 111133 delivered into their mouths at the southern 3113111113.
The Antarctic is the cradle of the 111133. It is here that the Sun and Μ 003 have presided over 111311 birth,

and it is here also that they are, so to speak, abandoned to the guidance of their own conjointal tendencies.

The luminaries continue 10 113131 round the earth, (apparently,) from East to West. The tides 30103331·
follow them. The Atlantic, for example, opens up to them a long deep 33331, running from North to South,
and after 1113 great tidal elevation has entered the mouth of this Atlantic canal‚ it moves continually north·
ward3 for the second twelve hours of its life it travels North from the Cape os Good Hope and Cape Horn,
and at the end os 1113 first twenty-four hours os its existence, has brought high water to Cape Blanco on the
West 01 Africa and Newfoundland on the American continent. Turning now round to the eastward, and
at right-angles to its original direction, this great 111131 wave brings high water during the morning of the
second day, to 1113 western coasts of Ireland and England. Passing round the northern Cape of Scotland,
it reaches Aberdeen 31 3003, bringing high water also to the opposite coasts of N orway and Denmark. It
has now been traveling precisely in the opposite direction 10 11131 of its 3333313, 3311 13 1113 opposite direction
also to the relative motion 01 1113 Suu 3311 Moon. But its erratio course 13 not yet complete. It is now

traveling from the northern mouth of the German Ocean northwards. At midnigbt of the second day it is
