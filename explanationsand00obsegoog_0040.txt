c‘bpies 011113111ος3, as sar at least as they related to these observationS, with a view to their being examined,
discussed and embodied in charts 01 1113 winds and currents, and in the compilation of sailing directions to
every port of the globe. For some years the instructions thus furnished received very little attention, and
very few observations were made or communicated 3 the publication, however, in 1848, 01 301113 0113113, 10111111-

South America, was sufficient to satisfy some 011113 more intelligent shipmasters 011113 object and real import-
ance 01 1113 scheme, and in less than two years from that time it had received the cordial co-operation 01 1113
masters 01 nearly every ship that sailed. At the ‘present time there are nearly 1000 masters of ships who
are engaged in making these observations; they receive sreely in return the charts of the winds and currentS,
and the sailing directions which are formed upon them, corrected up to the latest period.

⁶ “ Short as is the time that this system has been in operation, the resultsto which it has led have proved

of very great importance to the interests of navigation and commerce. The routes to many of the most fre-
quented ports in different parts of the globe have been materially shortened, that to St. Francisco in California
by nearly one-third: a system 01 southwardly monsoons in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic and on the

west coast 01 Α11131103 1133 113311 discovered 3 a vibratory motion of the trade-wind zones‚ and with their belts

of calms and their limits for ever-y month of the year, has been determined ; the course, bifurcationS, limits
and other phenomena 01 the Great Gulf-stream have been more accurately defined, and the existence of almost
equally remarkable systems of currents in the Indian Ocean, on the coast of China, and on the North-western
coast of America and elsewhere has been ascertained ; there 313, 111 fact, very few departments os the science

of meteorology and hydrography which have not received very valuable additions3 whilst the most accurate
determination os the parts of the Pacific Ocean (which are very limited in extent), where the sperm—whale is

10111111, 33 well as the limits os the range 01 those os other specieS‚ has contributed very materially to the suc-

cess 01 the American whale fishery, one of the most extensive and productive 01 311 1113 fields of enterprise

and industry.

“ The success 01 11113 system of co-operative observations has already led to the establishment of socie-
ties at Bombay and Calcutta, for obtaining, by similar 11133113, 3 1131131 knowledge of the windS, 0111131113, 31111
1113 0011133 01 1113 streams of the Indian 3333.

“ But it is to the government of this country that the demand 101 co—operation, and for the interchange
01 observationS, is most earnestly addressed by the government of the United States ; and the Presidvnt and
Council of the Royal Society, express their hope that it will not be addressed in vain. We possess in our
ships os war, in our packet service and in our vast commercia] navy, better means of making such observa-

ship which is under the control of the Admiralty should be furnished with instruments properly constructed
and compared, and with proper instructions sor using them: similar instructions 101 making and recording
