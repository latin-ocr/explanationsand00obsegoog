of atmosphere, and of no such force in nature, and in this age therefore men would scarcely receive such a
conjecture, as one having plausibility enough to command their respect.
Abandoning this, therefore, we are led to another conjecture, which is, that the motion of the air in the

general system of circulation is not exactly such as 1 have already described3 but that the N. E. trade winds

sor instance, when they reach the equatorial calms, instead of turning back towards the north, as I have
supposed, keep on towards the South, and the S. E. trade winds make the tour north. In this case, the course
of the windS, as described by Somnos, would be, as represented by the arrOWS, along the wavy curveS, (Plate
Π,) A, B, C, D, to the South Pole, thence up with the arrow P and around with the hands of a watch, and
back as indicated by the arrows along E, F, G, and H. Of course, as the surface winda, H, and D, approach
the poles, there must be a sloughing off, ir I may be allowed the expression, of air from the sursace windS‚ in
consequence of their approaehing the poles. For as they near the poleS, the parallels become smaller and

smaller, and the sursace current must either extend much higher up, and blow with greater rapidity, as it approaches

the poleS, or else a part of it must be sloughed off above, and so turned back before reaching the poleS. The

latter is probably the case.
If this plate and description fairly represent the course of the winds‚ we shall see that the S. E. trade winds

would enter the northern hemisphere, and bear into it all their moisture, except that which is precipitated in
the region of equatorial calms.

The South sea, then, if this reasoning be good, supplies mainly the water sor this engine, while the northern
hemisphere condenses it3 we should, therefore, have more rain in the northern hemisphere. The rivers tell us
that we have—at least on land: the great water courses of the globe, and half the fresh water in the world,
are found on our side of the equator. This fact, alone, is strongly corroborative of this hypothesis.

The rain guage tells us also the same story. The yearly average of rain in the North Temperate Zone is
according to Jonus‘rmr, 37 inches. He gives but 26 in the South Temperate.

⁰ Moisture is never extracted from the air by subjecting it from a low to a higher temperature, but the
reverse. Thus, all that air which comes loaded with moisture from the other hemisphere, and is borne into
this, with the S. E. trade windS, travels in the upper regions of the atmosphere until it reaches the calms of

Cancer—here it becomes the sursace wind that prevails from the southward and westward. As it goes North

it grows cooler, and the process of condensation commence8.*

We may now liken it to the wet sponge, and the decrease of temperature to the band that squeezes that
sponge. Finally reaching the cold latitudeS, all the moisture that a dew point of πετο, and even sar below,
can extract, is rung from it; and this air then commences “to return according to his circuits'' as dry
atmosphere. And here we can quote Solomon again: “ The North wind driveth away rain.'' This is a

meteorological fact of high authority and great importance in the study of the circulation of the atmosphere.
