crncuLATtoN OF 'rm-3 ATMOSPHERE. 93

It rains more in the valley drained by that river than is evaporated from it again. 'rh-e difference for a
year ‘is the volume of water annually discharged by that river into the sea.

At the time and place that the vapor which supplies this immense volume of water was lifted by the
atmosphere up from the sea, it was reasoned that the thermometer stood higher than it did at the time and
place where it was condensed and fell down as rain in the Mississippi valley.

1 looked to the South for the springs in the sea which supply the fountains of this river with rain. But
1 could not find spate evaporating‘ surface enough for it in the first place; and if the vapor, I could not find
the winds which would convey it to the right place.
³ The prevailing winds in the Caribbean sea, and southern parts of the Gulf of MexicO, are the N. E. trade
windS. They have their offices to perform in the river basins of tropical America, and the rains which they
may discharge into the Mississippi valley now and then are exception8‚ not the rule.

. The winds from the North cannot bring vapors from the great lakes to make rains for the Mississippi, for
two reasons; first: the basin of the great lakes receives from the atmosphere more water in the shape of rain
than they give back in the shape of vapor. The St. Lawrence river carries off the exceSS.

2d. The mean climate of the lake is colder than that of the M ississippi valley; and therefore, as a general
rule, the temperature of the Mississippi valley is unfavorable for condensing vapor from that quar-ter.

It cannot come from the Atlantic, because the greater part of the Mississippi valley is to the windward os
the Atlantic ocean. The winds that blow across it go to Europe with their vapors 3 and in the Pacific, from
the parallels of California down to the equatur, the direction of the wind at the surface is from, not toward,
the basin of the Mississippi. Therefore it seemed to be established, with some degree of probability—or if

that expression be too strong—with something like apparent plausibility, that the rain winds of the Mississippi
valley, as the general rule, do not get their vapors from the North Atlantic ocean, nor from the Gulf of
Mexico, nor from the great lakes, nor from that part of the Pacific ocean over which the N. Ε. trade winds
prevail.

The same process of reasoning which induced me to look to the trade-wind region of the northern ,

hemisphere for the sources of the Patagonian taius, induced me to look to the trade wind regions of the South
Pacific ocean, for the vapor springs of the Mississippi.

1 therefore last summer addressed a circular letter to the sarmers and planters of the Mississippi valley,
requesting to be informed as to the direction of the rain winds of each locality; and with the view of acquiring

some idea as to the general hygrometric condition of the atmosphere, 1 asked also to be informed as to the kind

and quality of fruits and the like.
To this 1 have received the following replies 3—-
From J. M. Janney, Warren cormty, Oltio.
Lat. 390 30‘ N.; Long. 840 W.

Winds from the southwest, with but few exceptionS, bring rain3 this is the result of eleven and a half

years' observation.
