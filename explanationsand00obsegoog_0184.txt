On the 12th of December, aster lying to for two hourS, nothing was accomplished. Five experiments
were made with an oiled line, running out respectively 600, 20, 300, 550, and 200 sathomS. Two experiments
were also made dispensing with the oil, the sixth shot for the day being lost at a depth of 200 sathotns. The
seventb and last sounding for the day was made with three bars of iron lashed together, and having an aggre-
gate weight of twelve poundS. The line parted near the recl, after 1,000 sathoms had been run out.

Our time until the 16111 was spent in waxing the twine preparatory to other experimentS. On this day,
in observed latitude 210 34’ North, and longitude by chronometer, 630 23’ West, the line ran out in 28 minuteS,
and parted at 1,600 ΐειὶὶιοωε.

This is the extent of our experimentS‚ and the best results we have been able to attain. Ι am convinced,
from the frequent parting of our line under such various circumstances, with reduced tension, at such different
lengthS‚ with equal strain, and with repeated marks of fracture in the strandS, that the twine fumished was
not suitable for our use. If the knots had been well fastened, and the strength of the line equal in all its partS,
results more satisfactory to oursclves and more valuable to others might have been obtained.

I have reason to commend the perseverance and scientific skill with which these experiments have been
prosecuted by Lieut. Taylor. I am confident that every effort within our power was made by him to render
these soundings as complete and accurate as the materials surnished us would warraut.

Since discovering the defectiveness of the line, and observing its liability to fracture,-especially at great
lengths, 1 have been suspicious that in no case we had reached the bonnm, although the cessation of the strain
upon the line had been regarded as indicating a legitimate sounding.

About 14,000 fathoms of the sounding line supplied us yet remain, with which J shall continue experi-
ments at the first opportunity. ‘

Hammo, Island qs Gaba, January eom, 1851.-1 beg leave (continues Capt. Platt, further) to report the
progress of our experiments in deep sea soundingS. Subsequently to the attempts reported on the 18th of
December, 1850, our next sounding was made on the 29th of the same mouth, in latitude 170 54’ North, and
longitude, by chronometer, 670 28’ West,—being below the Mona Passage, midway between the west eud os
Porto Rico and Mona island. Theline used on this occasion was waxed, and the sounding was made with-
out once severing it3 1200 fathoms of line were run out in 17 minuteS, with a drift of about one-hals a mile.
The temperature of the air 810, and of the water 840. ’

On the 4th of January, 1851, being becalmed in going out of St. Doming0‚ soundings were found with
a vertical line of 370 sathoms, the ship lying about nine miles from land,—latitude 180 30’ North, longitude
690 41' West. Temperature of the air 800, and os the water 820. The line ran out in five minuteS. It was
waxed, and did not part except in the effort to recover the shot.

With a similar line, on the next day, January 5th, at 4 P. M., we found bottom in nineteen minuteS, at
1275 sathomS, with about one-half a mile drift. We lay in latitude 170 16‘ North, and longitude 710 26ὲ’
West, with Altavela in sight. Temperature of the air 820, and of the water the same.

On the 13th of January, at noon, three unsuccesssul attempts at soundings were made with a waxed line,
