them make their observations upon it·‚ and many more, if invited, would do the same. But no one has invited
co·operation 3* consequently there is no system, and each one that observeS, observes only sor himself ; and
when he quits the sea, his observations go with him, and are to the world as though they had not been. ⁰ ⁹

“ Supposing the pressure os the waters that are forced into the Caribbean Sea by the trade winds tc, be
the sole cause of the Gulf Stream, that sea and the Mexican Gulf should have a much higher level than the
Atlantic. Accordingly, the advocates of this theory† require for its support ‘a great degree of elevation.’
Major Rennell likens the stream to ‘ an immense river descending srom a higher level into a plain.’ Now,
we know very nearly the average breadth and velocity of the Gulf Steam in the Florida Pass. We also
know, with a like degree of approximation, the velocity and breadth of the same waters off Cape Hatteras.
Their breadth here is about 75 miles against 32 in the ‘ Narrows’ of the StraitS, and their mean velocity is
three knots off Cape Hatteras against sour in the ‘ Narrows.’ This being the case, it is easy to show that the
depth of the Gulf Steam off Hatteras is not so great as it is in the ‘ Narrows’ of Bemini by nearly fifty per
cent., and that, consequently, instead of descending, its bed represents the sursace of an inclined plane from
the North, up which the lower depths of the stream must ascend. Is we assume its depth off Bemini to be
two hundred fathom3‚ which are thought to be within limits, the above rates of breadth and velocity will give
one hundred and fourteen fathoms for its depth off HatteraS. The waterS, therefore, which in the Straits, are
below the level os the Hatteras depth, so far from descending, are actually forced up an inclined plane, whose
submarine ascent is not less than ten inches to the mile !

“ The Niagara is an ‘ immense river descending into a plain) But instead of preserving its character in

Lake Ontario as a distinct and well defined stream {or several hundred mile8‚ it spreads itself out, and its

waters are immediately lost in those of the lake. Why should not the Guls Stream do the same? 1t gradually
enlarges itself it is true3 but instead of mingling with the ocean by broadspreading as the ‘immense rivers’
descending into the northern lakes dc, its waterS, like a stream os oil in the ocean, preserve their ‹listinctive
character for more than 3‚000 mileS.

“ Moreover, while the Guls Stream is running to the North from its supposed elevated level nt the South,
there is a cold current coming down from the North ; meeting the warm waters of the Gulf midway the ocean,
it divides itself and runs by tlze side of them right back into those very reservoirs at the South, to which thoery
gives an elevation sufficient to send out entirely across the Atlantic a jet os warm water said to be more than
three thousand times greater in volume than the Mississippi river. This current from Baffin's Bay has not

only no trade winds to give it a head; but the prevailing winds are unfavorable to it, and for a great part os
