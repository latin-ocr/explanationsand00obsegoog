Those of the Amazon are supplied with rains from the equatorial calms and trade winds of the Atlantic. That
river runs E„ its branches come from the North and South 3 it is always the rainy season on one side or the
other of it; consequently it is a river without periodic stages of a very marked character. It is always near
its high water mark. For one half of the year its northern tributaries are flooded‚ and its southern, for the
other half. It discharges under the line, and as its tributaries come from both hemisphereS, it cannot be said
to belong exclusively to either. It is supplied with water from the Atlantic ocean.

Taking the Amazon, therefore, out of the count, the Rio de la Plata is the only great river of the southern

hemisphere.

There is no large river in New Holland. The South Sea Islands give rise to none, nor is there one worth
naming in South Africa that we know os.

The great rivers os North America and North Africa, and all the rivers of Europe and Asia, lie wholly
within the northern hemisphere. How is it then, considering that the evaporating surface lies mainly in the
southern hemisphere—how is it, l say, that we should have the evaporation to take place in one hemisphere
and the condensation in the other? The total amount of rain which falls in the northern hemisphere is much
greater, meteorologists tell us, than that which falls in the southern. The annual amount of rain in the North
Temperate Zone is half as much again as that os the Sbuth Temperate.

How is it then, that this vapor gets from the southern into the northern hemisphere, and comes with such
regularity‚ that our rivers never go dry, and our springs fail not? Itis because of the beautiful operations and
the exquisite compensativa of this grand machine—the atmosphere. It is exquisitely and wonderfully coun-
terpoised. Late in the fall, throughout the winter, and in early spring, the Sun is pouring his rays with the
greatest intensity down upon the seas of the southern hemisphere3 and this powerful engine which we are
contemplating is pumping‘up the water there for our rivers with the greatest activity. At this time, the mean
temperature os the entire southern hemisphere is said to be about 10Ο higher than the northern.

The heat which this heavy evaporation absorbS, becomes latent, and with the moisture is carried through

, the upper regions of the atmosphere‚ until it reaches our climateS. Here the vapor is formed into cloudS‚ con-
densed and precipitated. The heat which held this water in the state of vapor is set free, it becomes sensible
heat, and it is that which contributes so much to temper our winter climate. It clouds up in winter, turns
warm, and we say we are going to have falling weather. That is because the process of condensation has
already commenced, though no rain or snow may have fallen3 thus we see'l this southern heat that has been
bottled away in the clouds of southern summer, and set free in the process of condensation in our northern

winter.
While evaporation is going on with most activity in the southern hemisphere, precipitation is taking place

to the greatest extent bere3 the fall spell, the winter rainS, and the “long season in May,'’ are familiar terms

of wet weather to us all. These are the seasons at which we look for high water, and expect our ‘⁶ inland

seas'' to be in good navigable order.

The vapor comes through the upper regions of the atmosphere‚ and is probably condensed here not many
