centre, the Latitude and Longitude of the soundings with as much accuracy as the scale on which the plate is
constructed will admit. Those soundings which have above them and this little circle, a dash with a dot over
the middle of it, indicate that at the depth expressed by the figures below, in fathoms os 6 feet to the fathom,
there was ὃ( no bottom,'’ according to the official report.

The shnded bands represent the one, two, three and four thousand fathom steppes at the bottom of the
Atlantic. That is, from the shore to the outer edge of the darkest shading, the sea is less than 1‚000 fathoms
deep; within the space covered by the next deepest shading‚ it is between 1,000 and 2,000 sathoms deep;
within the space covered by the next shading it is between 2‚000 and 3,000 fathoms deep; the lightest shading

is intended to show where tne ocean is more than 3,000, but less than 4,000 sathoms deep; and where there

is no shading, the representation intends to show that the sea is inore than 4,ooo fathoms deep.

With this explanation it will be perceived that the tracing of these various curves is in many placeS, and
sor the most part, matter os conjecture; they can be accuraztely drawn only where soundings have been actually
obtained, and the plate itself shows, therefore, what parts of the curves are drawn from data and what by con·
jecture-the latter being by sar the greater part.

All that is hoped to be accomplished by this plate for the present, is to enable persons to form some·
thing like a general idea as to the shape os the Atlantic basin so far at least as the deep-sea soundings returned

to this office would enable one to do, and to excite an interest among officers; hoping that with the promise of
such interesting results before them, officers will be induced to pay more attention to the subject of deep-sea

soundings, and to the order at page 174, which makes it their duty to get casts whenever practicable-than
generally they have done.

One of the conclusions which it would seem that we are authorized to draw from thus presenting the results,
so far obtained, is this, viz: that is there be any part of the Atlantic Ocean between the banks of Newfound·
land and the Equator, more than 5‚000 fathoms deep, it is probably no great part in comparison to the whole.

Another feature exhibited as to the shape of this great oceanic basin as represented by plate XIV, is that
it is deepest where theory and the projection of the cotidal lines by physicists represent it to be. However it is
to be hoped, that the day is not far distant when we shall have deep sea soundings enough to enable us to
represent to the nearest 1,000 fathoms at least, the steppes that lead up from the greatest depths of the Ahantic
ocean to the shore line. This, it will be observed, one deep-sea sounding in every space os 50 square made
by the crossing of the meridiam, with the parallels of Latitude on plate XIV, would enable us to do. In other
words, one cast for deep-sea soundings in every area on the average of about 75,ooo square miles of the ocean,
would enable us to give, with considerable aconmcy, the depth and shape os this marine basin to the nearest
1,000 sathoms or 6,ooo feet. It is therefore hoped that officers when sounding will prefer to make their

castS, in those squares represented on the plate, within the limits of which squares no cast has been made.

This plate was drawn by Professor Flye from the data contained in the chapter on deep-sea soundings,

page 175. He has also constructed at my request—
