750, temp. water 760. Nearly calm, no drift. Ι was much surprised at the great difference between this
sounding and the preceding one, but there is no reason to doubt their entire accuracy.

December 13th, 1851,-6οῒ bottom with 1916 fathomS, latitude 270 101 North, longitude 750 06’ West ;
time of running, 43 minutes 13 seconds. Temp. air 810, temp. water 760. Drift one mile an bour.

December 14th, 1851,-Π being quite calm at 9 Α. Μ., sounded, but unfortunately the line par-ted after
running 1590 fathomS. ‚1 regretted this accident, (the· first that has happened to our new line, which is
os superior quality) very much, as the line was quite perpendicular. A breeze springing up, Ι concluded to
defer another trial until evening. At 5 P. M., we sounded again, and got bottom with 1,874 fathoms line;
time of running, 52 minutes 4 seconds. Latitude 260 28¹ North, longitude 730 50 West. Temp. air 780,
temp. water 760. Drift, three fourths of a mile an bour. ,

On tbe 15th December, 1851, the deepest sounding was taken that has yet been made by this ship3 got
bottom with 4396 sathoms line; time of running, 1 bour 52 minutes 57 seconds. Latitude 250 30’ North,
longitude 720 07Ι West. Temp. air 780, temp. water 760. Drist, one mile an bour.

On the 16111 December, 1851, bottom was got with 2100 satboms line; time of running, 48 minutes 7
secondS. Latitude 24⁸0 48¹ North, longitude 700 22’ WVest. Temp. air 800, temp. water 790. Drift, three·
fourtbs of a mile an hour.

On the 17th December, 1851, we commenced sounding in a calm, and ran out 3,600 fathoms line, without

getting bottom. A breeze springing up abead caused the line to foul under the bottom. Latitude 240 41¹

North, longitude 690 39‘ West. Temp. air 840, temp. water 800. Time of running, 2 hours 6 minutes 36
seconde. This experiment was made with one of the leads that were sent out with the line. It proveS, Ι
think, that they are too light, or tbat their shape is not the best for rapid descent. On the loth inst„ a 32
pound shot, was used, which went 800 fathoms deeper in 14 minutes less time.

December 19th‚ 1851,-8οῑ bottom with 2,990 sathoms line; time of running, 1 hour 19 minutes 50
secondS. Latitude 220 40’ North, longitude 690 00' West. Temp. air 800, temp. water 800. Drift, three·
fourths of a mile an bour.

On tbe 9th January, 1852, our next experiment was made. In the interval, the ship visited Cape Haytien
and cbagres. The passage between xthose two ports was particularly unfavorable for sounding, the wind

being very fresh, and the sea high. Upon the date last mentioned, being on my passage from Chagres to
his place, in latitude 90 44’ North, longitude 810 01' West, got bottom with 1,690 sathoms line; time of

running, 32 minutes 29 secondS. Temp. air 870, temp. water 810. Drift, three fourths os a mile an bour.
