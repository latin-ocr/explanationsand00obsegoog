What the greatest depth of the ocean may be, has ever been a matter of speculation among philosophers‚
an object of longing desire and curious inquiry among marinerS.

Many questions of deep interest touching the physical condition of our planet are connected with the
depths of the sea.

The basin of the Atlantic ocean separatos the Old World from the New; it is a long channel, with some
conformity of outline along its opposite shores. The basin or trough in which those waters are held, extends
from the Antarctic to the Arctic seaS, perhaps from pole to pole. What is the depth of this trough?

The tides attain their greatest rise and fall as their waves roll, or rather undulate from South to North
through this deep and narrow channel.

Do the tides rise higher upon the borders of this sea than elsewhere, because its channel is deeper, or its
depths freer than the depths os other seas are from obstructions to the tidal wave ?

This great marine trough lies between the Andes and South America on one hand, and the mountains of
Africa on the other—each range shooting forth its peak far beyond the limits of perpetual snow. Is the bed
of the Atlantic depressecl in proportion to these elevations-—and is that proportion in an increased or ‹liminished
ratio? Nothing that relates to' the physica] condition os our planet can be without interest, and knowledge
with regard to every feature os the Earth, sea or air, is profitable.

It is wise to seek for it, for the ways of nature are the patha of wisdom‚ and whoever seeks to tread in

them is profitted‚ both be and bis generation‚ by the mere attempt.

The bottom of the Atlantic ocean, indeed, 1 might say, the bottom of what the sailor calls “ blue water,''
is, with bere and there an exception, all over the world, as unknown to us as is the interior of the other planets
of our system.

Astronomcrs have measured the volume: and weighed the masses of those distant spheres. But neither

the curiosity, nor the explorationS, nor the researches of man have ever succeeded in penetrating fai-ther than
a few feet into the crust os our planet.

From the top of the Himalaya to the depth of Lieutenant Walsh's great sounding in the “ Taney„ would
measure in a vertical line, about 12 miles. Before this sounding was taken, the vertical reach of the deepest
cast of the plummet at sea, added to the perpendicular elevation os the highest mountain on the land,
measured only about ten mileS. -

What the capacity of those reservoirs which contain the waters that perform such an important part in
the economy os the terrestrial arrangement may be, is certainly a matter of inquiry as profitable, as instructive
and as useful as the delineation on our maps of mountain ranges and other configurations of the Earth's surface.

Therefore, in this undertaking to collect physica] data that we may from them gain knowledge as to the
phenomena displayed by the air and the ocean, the subject of deep sea soundings did not escape the attention
os an enlightened government wisely administered.

Congress bad given the Secretary of the Navy authority to have deep sea soundings made by our men-of-

war wherever they go ; and to employ the armed cruisers of the government as they pass to and fro about their
