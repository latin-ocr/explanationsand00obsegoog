Auernum« noumS, ETC· 1111

This is a very bald log that Capt. McKay has returned, but I have quoted it to illustrate the homeward
route from the Sandwich 18188118, and in proof also of the regularity of the N. W. windS, which about the ’
parallel of 500 8011111 818 found to prevail from the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope around by the East,
even to the vicinity of Cape Horn.

Though Captain McKay 1188 been very sparing of his remarks, 118 has nevertheless hit the best route from
the Sandwich Islands to Cape Horn. He made only one mistake by the way and that was in getting from the
S. E. Trades through the belt of Horse Latitude weather into the Northwest TradeS, I may call them, of 1118
8081118111 hemisphere.

‚ ln passing from 088 system of Trades 10 1118 011181, 01 from the Trades 10 1118 variableS, there is always
a debatable ground which belongs neither to Trades nor variables. This debatable ground between the
Trades about 1118 Equator is called the “Doldrums.” Between the Trades and the variables of the extra-
tropical 1881088, 11 18 called the “ Horse Latitudes.” ο

In these debatable groundS, calms and baffling winds are to be expected, sometimes of several weeks,

and often of many (1898, and occasionally of only a few hours’ duration. And the rule for crossing these belts

is, whenever there is sea-room, to steer due North or South according 10 your destination.

Therefore, in coming from the Sandwich or the Society Islands or Calisornia, 10 Cape Horu, the rule
should beto go South as fast as possible, in order to get in 1118 N. W. Trade wind region of that ocean

with its heaving sweIIS. Ufitil you get into the region of these windS, no course can be given. The best
passages’ are to be made by crossing the Trades with top-mast studding 88118 881.

And in illustration of this Ι have but to refer again 10 1118 abstract 108 of the “ Sovereign of the Seas,’'
of the “ Comet’' and the “ Flying Dutchman.” Τ118 two last, though they lost the S. E. trades in about
300, did not get the regular westerly winds, for some ten days afterwards, near the parallel of 48ο or 500.

All three of these ships were in this debatable ground of Capricorn in the Atlantic, from two 10 three days;
the “ Sovereign of the the Seas” meking only 68, 84 and 72 miles a day; the “ Comet'’ 27 and 43 miles
on two successive days; the “ Flying Dutchman ’' 46 and 104. Indeed it may be said that these ships fell
in with the baffling winds of the Horse Latitudes 3d April, when they lost the N. W. Trades.

Returning therefore 10 1118 route to Australia and thence 1101118 via Cape Horn, Ι beg to impress navigatore
with the fact that 1 am not prepared to speak as 10 1118 188 11181 1889 118 expected so low down as the parallel 0155ο
01 600 south, between the meridian os the Cape of Good Hope and Van Dieman’s land; and therefore, navigatore
who take these Sailing Directions for their guide, must judge for themselves as 10 dangers from the 188 119
1118 route of which Ι am now treating.' Abstract 1088 818 entirely wanting in that region, and 1 speak on
the saith of theoretical deductions as to this route.

A clipper ship well handled and with a good streak of luck in making the run from the United States into
the variables of the southern hemisphere, will be able now and then 10 make the passage to Australia by this

‘0⁰¹0 5¹¹ 55 <¹85⁸ if not 5¹¹ 1088 ῒῖωθῖ but 18 55 days it can be accomplished under canvass alone. It used to

be a ten months’ voyage.
