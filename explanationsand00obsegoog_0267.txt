waters of the Atlantic is perfectly distinct to the eye for several hundred miles, and even at the distance os a
thousand mileS, though the two waters have been in contact and continued agitation for many dayS, the ther·
mometer shows that the cold water on either side still per-forms the part of river banks in keeping the warm
waters os the stream in their proper channel.

“ In a winter's day off Hattera8‚ there is a difference between these waters of near 200. Those of the
Gulf being warmer,·we are taught to believe that they are lighter3 they should therefore occupy a higher level
than those through which they float. Assuming the depth here to be 114 fathoms‚ and allowing the usual rates
os expansion, figures show that the middle of the Guls Stream ‘here should be nearly 2 feet higher than the con·
tiguous waters of the Atlantic. Were this the case, the sursace of the-stream would present a double inclined
plane, from which the water would be running down on either side, as from the roos of a house. As this ran
off at the top, the same weight of colder water would run in at the bottom 3 and thuS, before this mighty stream
had completed hals its course, its depths would be brought up to the surface, and its waters would be spread

out over the ocean. Why then does not such a body os warm water, flowing and adhering together through

a cold sea, obey this law, and occupy a higher level? If it did, the upper edges of its cold banks would sup-
port a lateral pressure of at least 100 le. to the square soot ; and vessels in crossing it, would sail over a

ridge as it were3 on the east side os which, they would meet an easterly current ; and on the west side, a

westerly current. ·

“ The maximum temperature of the Guls Stream is 860, or about 9ο above the ocean temperature due the

latitude. Increasing its latitude 100, it loses but 20 of temperature. And, aster having run 3‚ooo miles

towards the North, it still preserveS, even in winter, the beat os summer. With this temperature it crosses the
40th degree of north latitude, and there, overflowing its liquid beaks, it spreads itsels out for thousands of
square leagues over the cold waters around, and covers the ocean with a mantle os warmth that serves so
much to mitigate in Europe the rigors of winter. Moving now more slowly, but dispensing its genial influ-
ences more freely, it finally meets the British IslandS. By these it is divided, one part going into the polar
basin of Spitzbergen‚ the other entering the Bay of Biseay‚ but each with a warmth considerably above ocean
temperature. Such an immense volume of heated water cannot fail to carry with it beyond the seas 3 mild
and moist atmosphere. And this it is which so much sostens climate there.

“ May there not exist between the waters os the stream and their fluid beaks, always heaving and moving

to the swell os the sea, 3 sort ofperistaltic force, which, with other agents, assists to keep up and preserve this

wonderful system of ocean circulation? ·

“ The line of meeting between the waters of the Gulf Stream and the Atlantic is distinct to the naked
eye for several hundred miles. This unreadiness of cold and tepid sca-water to commingle has been often
remarked upon, and seems to impart to one current the power of dividing and turning others aside. Thus the

Gulf Stream bifurcates the Labrador current, one part of which underruns the Gulf Stream, and the other takes

a southwestwardly direction along the coast. ·
