You will not fail to remark tho difference between these intervals, and those of this forenoon. 1 cannot

account sor them. There never was a better chance sor accuracy, as the ship was perfectly still, and the ·

observers careful.

The positions that 1 have given you are only approximate ones; we did not get a good meridiari obser·
vation but our latitude could not have been any greater, though it might have been somewhat less. I think
that our longitude is too great, though 1 cannot guess how much3 perhaps eight or ten minutes. .

You will wonder, perhap8, how we came to be so far out of our reckoning'this morning, but it can
easily be explained. At 6 Ρ. Μ., of the 8th, we got a departure from the light on the Double Headed Shot
Key8‚ and from that time up to this morning, we were threshing about in this rapid current, tacking and veering
every few hourS, and without getting hold os any land mark, or securing any observatione.

I have at length made the experiment of sounding with sewing silk, and find that it will not do ; it un·
twistS, and soon parts; if laid up into a small cord, (say three part8,) 1 have no doubt it would answer, but
then it would be too expensive. 1 tried at first a small weight of two or three ounces; when nearly a hundred
sathoms had run off, it sank so slowly, that 1 began to reel it up, and in doing so, the thread parted. 1 next
tried a half pound weight3 the first hundred sathoms ran off in 1 minute 46 seconds ; the second hundred ran
off in 2 minutes 22 seconds3 the line· then parted.
