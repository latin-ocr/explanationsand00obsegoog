a warin under current in the South Atlantic ocean, for that almost seems to be the only place of escape for a

counter current from the Atlantic ἓ*
Lieut. wama, of the schooner “Tamyss’ and Lieut. S. P. Lamos the brig “Delphin,'' who were sent out
by the Government, to make certain observations in connection with these researches concerning the winds and

currents of the ocean, were at my request instructed, among other things, to examine for such a current.

On ,the General circulatim os the Atmosphere.†

Several years ag0, 1 commenced to gather from old sea journals, such information as they might be found
to contain, relative to the winds and currents of the sea, and to embody the information so obtained on a series
of chartS, in such a manner as to show by pictureS, the prevailing direction of the winds and currents for every
mouth, and in every part of the ocean. Indeed, the plan os the undertaking was to address the eye, to collect
the experience of every navigator, and to present the combined results of the whole in such a manner, that each
one might, with a glance, have the benefit of the experience of all who had preceded him in any of the frequented
parts of the ocean.

This enterprize has been seconded both by the government and individuals. American ship masters gene·
rally have come into it with great zeal. They make the observations required on every voyage, and send them

tome at Washington. There are some thousand or more ships voluntarily co-operating with me ε and as it

Dua Suis—On the 26th March ve crossed the (Guls) stream, andwhen in Lat: 3⁴055· N . and Long. 74008· W. , at 11 a. m.with a mode-
rate S. W. breeze blowing, temperature of air in the shade 6905, Ι put the thermometer in a bucket os surface vatem after 2 minutes immersion
it stood at 7405. Ι then proceeded to the main deck, to a vash deck pump, which receives its vater G} feet below the surface. Here 1
pumped 8 buekets os water, and in the eth placed the thermometer, which after 2 minutes immersion stood steady at 790. Ι went then
to the hold, and opened a cock 163 feet below the surface, and allowed it to run a full clear stream into the hold for 15 minutes. This 1
did that the cock and pipe might take the temperature of the water, and thus prevent the heat of the ship from affecting the water whose
temper-sture 1 desired to take. After it had run 15 minutes Ι drew a wooden bucket full in which Ι placed the thermometer as before.
After two minutes entire immersion it stood at 8605, thus showing clearly aad conclusively a differ-enee between the surface water, and
that at the depth of 163 feet, of 120.

These results lcan assur-e you are exact, as the observatione were several times repeated without difference, and 1 am confident
thet the vater whose temperature 1 tested was in no degree affected by the heat of the vessel, 1 so carefully guarded against it.

This is the only time that 1 have been in the strength of the Gulf Stream3 but yesterday, the soth, in Lat. 240 10⁹, Iaong, 800 11¹
(which you will perceive by the chart, and which the observation itself proves, does not place us entirely within the influence of the
Suam, but very near its edge) 1 took another set of temperatures.

The thermometer stood in the shade at 790, surface water was 780, and water from the depth os 163 feet stood aster a sair and
deliberate trial at 790.5. The vvater from the c} feet pump 1 did not try, as there was so much sea on, that there could be no certainty
whether it came from the sursece or 12 feet below. 1 have had no further opportunities for observatione of this character, than these, but
1 hope that these, scanty as they are, may be gratifying to you. 3

Very truly youn»
