The “ Vincennes’‘ came out of Sandy Hook, November 13th, and had the wind out from the westward
till the 15th, making a fine run to d, as per Plates XI and XII.

On the 18th the wind came out from the South, and continued there, or with westing in it, for a week,
end then it hauled to the North, or so as to be mostly sair, for two days more. 1 have marked this place e on
the chart, and in the log. ο

With these fine wind8‚ what was that ship doing for this whole week ? Why, actually bugging a S. W.
wind, or standing as though she wanted to go to the West Indies,

She reached the Line the first time, it's true, in 30 days from New York, but too far to clear Cape St. Roque.

The track of the “ Vincennes” beautifully proves the correctness of the charts; it conforms in its general
direction to the track of the char-ts, but it is too sar off. Any one who will examine the Log of that ship—her
track, and my Sailing Directions—will see that it would be just about as reasonable for that ship to have gone
over to the Cape de VerdeS, (which would have been not quite as far on the other extreme‚) and then meeting
with a long passage of 60 dayS, to ascribe it to the chartS. The ship whose track 1 have marked ετ, might,

with the same propriety, ascribe her long passage to the charts also.

Navigators often follow the new route bravely, until they get into the equatorial calms; here their
heart seems to fail them, and they holt at the very time when they should stick more closely to their
guide.

The region which these calms usually include is in the shape of a wedge3 it shifts about, but Plates XI

and XII show its mean place at the four seasonS. In each season, it is sometimes above and sometimes be·

low the place assigned it on the chart. But Ι have drawn it there to show navigators how they mistake,
when being as far West even as 310 or 320, they fall into these calms, and think os making longitude by
fanning along to the eastward or an Ε. Ν. Ε. οι· perhaps a N. Ε. course. The farther they go on such occa·
sions, the broader grows the belt, and the greater becomes the difficulty of getting across it.

1 have projected on Plate XII, by a dotted line, the track of a ship, and marked it y, as an illustration of
bad management under such circumstances, though it is by no means an extreme case. This ship had 40 days
to the Line, took the new route, and followed it bravely until she reached the equatorial calinS, in longitude
290. She was then far enough to the eastward, and should not have been afraid to cross the Line as far West
as 320. But instead of proceeding to make the best of her way across this belt where it was narrow, and
where two or three days at most would have sufficed for crossing it, she proceeded ῐοᾞαρ along to the east—

ward as far as 21ος and thus, in consequence of the monsoonS, found herself to leeward. When at h, that
ship should, instead of making about an E. by S. course, have stood on the other tack, making the best of her
way South, and not caring to get east of 300. ‚She might have been content to keep herself between 290, or
300 and 310 or 320, while she crossed these calms.
l have not yet found a single case in which there has been, after crossing the Line as far as 320, the least
difficulty in clearing St. Roque. Navigators should not hesitate, if they are pinched, to go inside of Fernando
do Norhona. 1 have the track of one vessel that dashed on, crossed the line in 410 the 19th day out, and
