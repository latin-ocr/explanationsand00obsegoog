of the compass. ι ’

Thus, in the wind-rose for the district between 50 and 100 N ., 150 and 200 West, and marked A, Plate
V, he would observe that in August 705 observations as to the course of the wind had been made here, and
13 as to the calms; i. e., out osv-2¹,—2 dayS, or parts of dayS, passed by ships in this district during the month
of August of various years, the prevailing condition of the weather sor consecutive periods of eight hours
duration each, was found to be calm thirteen times 3 and the winds were observed to blow from E. 4 times 3⁸

The object has been ‘to get for these charts at least one hundred observations for each month in every
square of the ocean 3 this would require for the three great oceans 1‚669,200 observations upon the direction
of the winds alone.

In some os the wind-roseS, or districts of50 square, we have obtained more than a thousand observations
for a single month ; whereas, in neighboring districts and for other monthS, we are left without a single obser-
vation—so limited and‘marked are the commercial paths over the ocean, according to the seasonS.

ln the South Atlantic, between the route to and fro around Cape qun, and the route to and fro around
the Cape of Good Hope, there is a part of the ocean of immense extent, that is seldom traversed by any vesscl.

The pilot chartS, therefore, are silent with regard to the winds there.

As the wind is found to blow in any part of any given district or division of 50 square, so it is assumed
to blow in all other parts of that district.

The pilot chartS, therefore, give us the number of times that the wind, in any part of the ocean, is found
in a given number of times to come from each point os' the compass; and consequently, by studying the pilot

chart, we see the ratio between the number of winds from any one point, and the number of winds from all the

other points os the compass.
With such data it is practicable to calculate, according to the doctrine of chanceS, the track which will

give the shortest average passage under canvass from port sor any month.

This I have done for the routes generally, between Europe and America; and from the ports of the United
StateS, as far south as the parallel of Rio de J aneiro.

ln order to select the best average track, from one place to another, as from the ports of the United States
to Rio, or to those of Europe, the pilot charts have been discussed in the following manner:

Blank charts on a scale of 5Ο to an inch at the equator, Mercator's projection, are constructe-d and litho-

graphed sor the whole ocean, twelve times over, so as to have one complete set sor each month.
In every space, of 50 square, a sort of compass·card is drawn as in Plate VI.

In the centre os this card are written two numbers—the upper number shows the times—counting 8 hours

as “ a time'’—the winds have been observed in that square, or the given mouth, which in this case is J uly;
