Mistakes in the route to Rio are, 1 am happy to say, becoming much less frequent. The charts are evi-
dently much better understood now than they were formerly. Since the last edition of these ‘⁴ Sailing Direc·
tions„ went to preSS‚ no such mistake as that of the “ VincenneS,” has come to my knowledge.

With a view os contrasting the passages of the new route, 1 have taken the logs of all the vessels that have
come to hand between the publication of the fourth edition, and the going to press with the fifth edition of this
work, and from‘them tabulated the passages to the equator, and thence to clear-ing Cape St. Roque.

Τ he old route is nearly broken up. lt is now rarely attempted. But many vessels evidently aim to
“ split the difference ’² between the old route and the new, by steering a sort of middle course between them.
This I have called Tm: Mimas: Rou‘rn. ,

Some os the vessels which take this middle route, evidently set out with the intention of trying the new
routes‘but they get a little pinched ; or the winds are too favorable3 cr the dread os that bug-bear off
Cape St. Roque-a westwardly current—seizes them; or through sear of falling to leeward‚ of getting back-
strapped, &c., they go too far east and get delayed in the “ doldrum8.”

It will be seen, by consulting the Table, New Rom-13, pp. 400 et. seq„ that the mean crossing place on the
equator, by the vessels of the new route, is in 290 55¹ West 2—that out of the 88 vessels there recorded, but
two fell to leeward, both in October. They both crossed 50 N. in 370 W. ε a smart ship, we may therefore
inser, need not sear to cross the Line as far as 320 or 330 West, especially in the winter time.

Lieut. Kennedy‚ commanding the U. S. Store ship “ Supply,” on her recent voyage to Rio, mentions a
striking instance of the advantage os sticking to the charts, and conforming to the sniling directionS. He
crossed in the mouth os February, 34 days out, in Long. 330 W. He was pinched, and made the land ‘7 miles to
leeward os Cape St. Roque. He stood boldly on ; took advantage of a slant, as recommended, and got by
without any difficulty. The bark Polka, however, which was in company, stood off to the northward and east-

·ward in order to get an offing, and pass to windward of the Island of F ernaudo do Noronha. This brig

thougha better sailer than the “ Supply,” did not arrive until several days after the “ Supply.’' ¹*

January 6, 1850 (Lat. 390 N„ Long. 630 W.) at 10 a. m. a whirlwind passed between our sore and mninmasts, doing no damage.
At the same time, two others were observed, one on the port-bearn, the other on the starboard quai-ter. Their formation was very
sudden, giving no warning whatever of their approach3 nor was the soree or direction os the wind, which. at the time, was bloving
fresh, in the least affected ς the diameter os the one which passed between our masts was about ten feet with a rotnry velocity of about
one hundred miles per bour, and a progressive velocity os about sixty or seventy miles per hour. The oue on the port-bearn was

much linger, carrying with it large quantities os water, and moving with a higher velocity.
February 6, 1e50 (Lat. 10 40¹ N„ Long. 320 W. ,) at 331. 30:11. n large and heavy whirlwind· passed across our bow, about tvo

hundred yards distant, with a very high velocity, and carrying with it large quantities of water.

The ship did not suil well during the first part os the passage, having been stored out os trim, and griping to such a degree that all the
nails on her mizzen mast were useless, 1 could not make any change in her trim by shisting weight from one extreme (a bad way at
best) as every crack and crevice was crammed with stores, baggnge, &c-

The first part of the passage was rougb, and the south westerly winds drove me sar out of my track. 1 was at one time apprehen·
sive os being forced in sight of the ‘⁴ Cape de Verde lslands.”

When the “trade winds ’⁹ north os the Eduator began to sail me, the weather became equally, and the wind light3 though iu
general the aqualis were os rain only.

On the δώ os February, however, we bad some wind in them, and a violent whirlwind passed abead of the ship about two hun·

Ared yards. It would have passed over the ship, had it not been met, and driven abead os a squali.
