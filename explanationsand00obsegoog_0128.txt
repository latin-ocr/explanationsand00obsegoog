The quantity os moisture that the atmospbere keeps in circulation is, no doubt, just that quantity which
is best suited to the well-being, and most adapted to the proper development os the vegetable and animal
kingdoms; 3ηά that quantity is dependent upon the arrangement 3ηά the proportions that we see in nature ,
between the land and the water—between mountain and desert, river and sea. Is the seas and evaporating

surfaces were changed, and removed from the places they occupy‚ to other places, the principal places of pre·

cipitation probably would also be changed: whole families os plants would wither and die tor want of cloud
and sunshine, dry and wet, in proper proportions and in due season3 and, with the blight of plantS, whole
tribes of animals would also perish3 under such a chance arrangement, man would no longer be ableto rely
upon the early and the latter rain, or to count with certainty upon the rains being sent in due season for seed

time and harvest. ‘And that the rain will be sent in due season, we are assured from on High3 and when we
recollect who it is that “sendeth” it, we feel the conviction strong within uS, that He that sendeth the rain
has the winda for his messengers3 and that they may do his hidding, the land and the sea were arranged, both
as to position and relative proportionS, where they are, and as they are.

It should be borne in mind that the southeast trade winda, after they riae up at the equator‚ have to over·
leap the northeast trade winds. Consequently they do not touch the Earth until near the tropic of Cancer—
(see the bear-ded arrows, Plate IV) more frequently to the north, than to the south of it; but for a part of every
year, the place where these vaulting southeast trades first atrike the Earth, aster leaving the other hemisphere‚
is very near this tropic. On the equatorial side of it, be it remembered‚ the northeast trade winds blow3
on the polar side, what was the southeast tradeS‚ and what is now the prevailing southwesterly winda os our
hemisphere, prevail. Now examine Plate IV, 3ηά it ‘will be seen that the upper half of the Red sea is north
of the tropic of Cancer; the lower half, is to the south of it; that the latter is within the northeast trade wind
region3 the former, in the region where the southwest passage winds are the prevailing windS.

The River Tigris is probably evaporated from the upper half of this sea by these winds; while the north·
east trade winda take up from the ‘lower half, those vapors which seed the Nile with rain, and which the
clouds deliver to the cold demands of the Mountains of the Moon. Thus there are two ‘'‘wind-roads„ crossing
this sea: to the windward of it, each wind path is through a rainless regi0n; to the leeward there is, in each
case, a river to cross-

The Persian Gulf lies sor the most part in the track of the southwest winds 3 to the windward of the Persian
Gulf is a desert3 to the leeward, the Rigver Indus. This is the way in which theory would require the vapor
“ “ 3ηά Persian Gulf to be conveyed ; and this is the direction in which we find indicatione that
For to leeward do we find, in each case, a river, telling to us by signs not to be mistam,
nore water from the clouds than it gives back to the winda.

curious circumstance that the winda which travel the road suggested from the southern
ld, when they tom-hed the Earth on the polar side of the tropic of Cancer, be so thirsty, more

re, than those which travel on either side of their path', and which are supposed to have come

is, not from southern lands ?
