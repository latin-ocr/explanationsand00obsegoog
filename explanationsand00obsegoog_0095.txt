The Cancer zone of calms in the Atlantic ocean is known to American seamen as the “ Horse Latitudes,''
from the circumstance that the vessels formerly engaged in carrying horses from New England to the W'est
Indica, found it so difficult to cross this zonet they would often be detained in the calms for many days,
during which time the large eargo of horses would exhaust the stock of water, become frantie with thirst, and
to save¹ a part, the rest would have to be thrown overboard3 hence the name of “ Horse Latitudes„ to the
ealms near the tropics of Cancer, and which Ι have called by the name of that sign.

This is the place where the upper currents of air represented by ε’ and δ” meet; they balance each other,
produce a calm, and descend to re-appear as surface winds‚ one blowing to the North and the other to the
South from this calm belt.

Now ε’ could not bring the vapors here which form the rains that are precipitated between this calm belt
and the polar regions, because ς’ has already performed theyeireuit as a surface wind between this zone and
those regions; because⁴ in that circuit it had been subjeeted to a temperatura sar below zero, and had given
out all the moistu re that a dew point so very low could extract from it; and as it had returned in the upper
regions of the atmosphere where it encountered no fluid surface to replenish it with moisture‚ it had no vapor on
its arrival from the North at the calms of Cancer, to make rains of, except such as it may have evaporated
from the clouds, formed in the upper regions of the surface wind.

Hence if ξ’ returned to the North as a surface wind after descending in the calm zone os Cancer, it would
first have to remain a long time in contaet with the sea, in order to be supplied with vapor enough to fill the

great τίνει-ε, and supply the rains sor the whole Earth between us and the North pole.

In this ease we should have an evaporating region on the North as well as on the South side of this zone
os Cancer3 but the charts show no such region; 1 speak exclusively of the ocean.

Therefore 1 think 1 pereeive plausibility in the inference that ε’ does not come out on the North side of
this calm zone of Cancer, but on the South side; that thence it takes the circuit of the N. E. trade winds‚ in
which it is replenished with vapor. Now is it be admitted that such is the general course os ε’ it must of ne-
cessity be admitted that δ” probably re·appears on the North side of this zone, as the prevailing surface wind
which precipitates on its way to the Arctic regionS, the residuum os the vapor which it has taken up in the
trade wind region, and brought from the equatorial calms.

Moreover, if these premises be admitted thus far, and if it be true that δ” have the vapor which by eon-
densation is to water with showers the extra-tropica] regions of the northern hemisphere, nature we may be
sure, has provided a guide sor eonducting δ” across this belt os calms, and for sending it on in the right
way. Here it is at this crossing of the winds that 1 thought 1 first saw the foot prints of an agent whose
character 1 could not eomprehend. It was this guide to ε’ and δ’.

Heat and cold, the early and the latter rain are not distributed over the Earth by chance; they are dis·
pensed no doubt according to design, and in obedienee to laws that are as certain and as sure in their opera-

tions as the seasons in their rounds.

Is there were really, inlt2he calms of Cancer, a general mingling of the atmosphere which eomes from the
