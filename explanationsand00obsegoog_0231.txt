‚May lOtlz.—-Breeze so light as to be almost a calm3 occasionn! “ catspaws„ prevented our getting an
up and down sound. Got bottom with 2‚300 fathoms of line—Lat. 310 01' N.‚ Long. 440 31’ W. Air 6803
water 680. Time os running out, 1 hour 4 minutes 35 secondS. Drist.—

When we commenced to haul in the last time, Ι hauled in some four or five fathoms with my naked hand8‚
after getting in some forty or fifty fathom3‚ the line became as stiff as a bar of iton, and it required the full

strength of a very stout man to turn the crank of the reel—of course the line soon parted. We lost 2‚2oo

sathomS.

The last sound which we attempted in a moderate top-gallant breeze, the motion of the ship was so severe,
and the drift so considerable, that I found we might easily have lost the whole 7,000 sathoms without a result.
This has determined me to husband the 10,ooo sathoms of line now remaining for castS, when the prospect for
something satisfactory is more promising.

May 17t12.-Peak of Pico N. 180 Ε., distant 24 miles· Sounded in 670 fathoms water3 lost the whole
quantity os line out. ⁴

May msa—Lat· 350 07¹ N.‚ Long. 250 43' W. Temp. air 650, water 640. Found bottom with 1,040
fathoms line. Time os running out, 19 minutes 58 secondS.

May 29th.—·Madeira—arrived here day before yesterday—shall sail in one week for Porto Praya, where
we shall find Commodore or orders, Expect to return here in October. Ι have 7‚000 fathoms of good line

lest, and shall give you some soundings along the coast, and perhaps across to St. Helena.'' 0 0 0

 

The soundings of the “ John Adams'' confirm the conjecture of Captain Platt of the “ Albany‚'’ that he
did not get bottom on the 6th and 9th December, sor not far from his position on those days Captain Barron,
with the experience of the “ Albany'’ to guide him, reports a sounding of 2‚000 fathoms-18‚OOO feet—without
bottom.

The great sounding of 5,500 fathoms of May the 7112, corrected for drist, gives», if it be correct, 28‚950 feet,
as the greatest depth at which the bottom os the ocean has ever been reached. Lieut. Walsh, in the “ Taney‚'’

went deeper, but he got no bottom.
This sounding of the “John Adams” carries internal evidence of its correctness, at least down to a
certain depth. The rate os descent given for the depths of 2, 3, and 4 thousand sathomS, is a decreasing rate

and it conforme with {ge rate of the other soundings generally.
