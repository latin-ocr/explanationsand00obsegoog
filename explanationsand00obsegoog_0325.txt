ter, that the sea climate is not an extra-tropical one as its latitude indicates„ that it is the inter-tropical tempe-
rature of its waters which tempts the sperm whales to gambol there in such multitudes—then the discovery of
the fact that the sea water here is a little warmer, and that therefore there is a current running hither from the
equator, should be regarded as one which is due to the information which the study of the habits of this
animal has given us·

In the sperm whale region off the coast of Chili and Terra del Fuego, we have been taught to believe in the
existence of a cold current. Assuming this cold current to be there 3—that it is not crossed or divided by a

warm current, the resort of the sperm whales there must be regarded as an anomaly in the habits of the

creature.

These investigations as to the habits and places of resort os the whaIeS, have taught me to regard sperm
whales as much out of place in cold water, as the whalers themselves would regard out of place, 3 wilderness of
howling monkeys of the Amazon among the Green Mountains of Vermont.

The following notice from this office to whalemen, has been published in the newspapers of tlie day.

Nolice to Whalemen.

Nau-torus. Onsnnvaronr,
Washingtma, May, 1851.

Captain Daniel McKensie‚ of New Bedford‚ and George Manning, of New York, have been engaged for
a year or two in collecting materials for this office relating to the habits of the whale‚ διο.

These materiale have been used here by Lieutenants Herndon and Leigh, and by P. Mid. J acksou, of the
Navy, in making a Chart to show when and where our whalemen have searched for whaleS, when and where
they have found them—with what abundance‚ aud whether in schools or alone.

This chart divides the ocean into districts of 50 lat. by 5Ο long.; perpendicularly through each one of
which districte, are 12 columns for the 12 months3 and horizontally through each one of which districts are
three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two

others show the number of days on which whale8‚ sperm or right, have been seen. Thus:
