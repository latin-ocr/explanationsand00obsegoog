honr, stom 6 to 7 Ρ. Μ., 75.50 to 720, while standing to the northward and eastward, and the rise again the
next hour to 750, made me suspect the possibility of a moal, so that 1 put back, found the place again, and
sounded with 300 fathoms line, but got no bottom. It being thick squally weather, we could not attempt
deeper soundings.

The column of speczflc gravity-of sea-water calls for some remarkS. Our measurements hythe hydro-
meter show that in some partS, is not in most parts of the ocean, the water is specifically ligate,- at depths than.

at surface, when reduced to like temperature—the correction for this difference being applied. 1 found on

one occasion the following large difference ε On December 8th, at surface 1028.6, (distilled water as standard
held at 1000,) at 200 sathoms 1028.4; at 500 fathoms 10272, all at 600 temperature t this was in latitude
310 42' North, longitude 380 12' W. The specific gravlty generally found at surface appears about 1028.4
at 600 temperature3 and this specific gravity at sursace appears, according to our record, more variable than
at depths.

The greatest transparency os the water observed, as found in its column, was seventeen sathoms, being
able to see a large lead painted white, at that depth. This was in latitude 210 4’ N ., longitude 660 36¹ W.

The column of barometer contains the records of the improved marine mercurial barometer, got from
Tagliabue, in New York, which proved to be an excellent instrument, and most valuable to me, never failing
to warn of an approaching gale. The Aneroid, though not noticed in the “ Abstract,” was regularly recorded
in the Log, with the Mercurial, every four hours durihg the cruise. This may serve as a good test of its per·
sormance. It was set with the Mercurial on leaving New York in October. It commenced at once to differ,
indicating higher; and though its daily fluctuatione agreed well, this difference steadily increased until, by
the time we got back to New York, seven months after, it had reached as high as six-tenths of an inch above
it; thus acquiring an error of very nearly one-tenth of an inch a month. This leads me to doubt whether this
ingenious instrument can ever be sufficiently trusted to take the place of the Mercurial, though so much to be
desired.

The observations for the variatim» of the compass could be taken but seldom with exactneSS, and therefore
appear but seldom in the “ Abstract,” the needle being generally kept by our jumping little schooner in too
unsteady a state sor correct azimuths.

In conclusion, 1 must express my regn-ets that the most important part of the “ Instructions” was pre·
vented being carried out by the bad condition of the schooner‚ proving, on overhauling at Porto Praya, quite
unseaworthy. Ι allude to the investigations of the currents about Cape St. Roque, and of the volcanic region
of the South Atlantic near the equator. But Ι sincerely trust that the work will not be allowed to stop here—
that it will be continued under your instructionS, in connection with your “ Wmd and Ourrent C'kartS,'’ as has
been authorized by Congress. The employment of three suitable vessels was recommended by the bill 3 but
one has yet been employed, and that quite unsuitable in size and condition. A vessel of hutone hundred
tons, as is the “ Taney,” independent of being too unstable fot· the observations and the soundingS, cannot
carry officers and men enough sor the incessant aud laborious work required, nor provisions and water enough

to keep the sea sor long periods of time, as is essential on this service.'‘
