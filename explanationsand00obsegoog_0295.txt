Continuing on towards the South Pole, and approaching it in spiraIS, they whirl about, but in a direction
with the hands os a watch, and opposite to that which they took about the North Pole.
Ascending into the up'per regions of the atmosphere‚ they are next felt on the surface as S. Ε. trade

winds; reaching t'ne equator, ascending, and coming over into the northern hemisphere, they are again felt to
the North os the N. Ε. trades as the S. W. passage winds,

Let us suppose that this part of the circuit from the Antarctic regions be made in our summer, and of

course in the southern winter, when the vegetation here is not so active in its demands upon this atmosphere

.—

in motion, as it was in the other part of the supposed circuit.
But then this same atmosphere that has been but partially purified for northern use in the southern forests
and fields, reaches us in our summer, when vegetation is in full activity, and when, therefore, all dispropor·
tions are properly compensated.
1 have saith in the “ great first thought.” 1 believe that the animal and vegetable kingdoms are in exact
counterpoise ; that through the dominions of nature all things are in exact and rigid proportions3 that there is
not a green leaf too much on one side, nor an insect too many on the other. And because of this belief, I find

plausibility and satisfaction in supposing that the general system os atmospherical circulation is as I have been

endeavoring to represent it.

In this belief 1 am strengthened by my reading os a text os Scriptute, (and the Bible no more than Nature
can be wrong, for the Author of both is One,) which seems to apply to such a system of circulation:
“ The wind goeth towards the South, it turneth about unto the North, it whitleth about continually ; and

the wind returneth again according to his circuitS.”

Compare this with what I have already said, which my investigations taught me was the probable
course of atmospherical circulation before Ῑ remembered me of what Solomon had said, and I think you will

find with me, not proof, but grounds to suppose that such may be the system of atmospherical circulation.

The Wrale Obart.

In 1847, materials sufficient having been collected from the log books of whalers for an investigation

into the habits and places of resort of the whale, Lt. Wm. L. Herndon commenced the construction of this

“ whale chart ’' sor the whole ocean, excepting the North Atlantic.

The object of this chart is to show at a glauce, where this fish have been most hunted3—when, in
what yearS, and in what months it has been most frequently found—whether in shoals, as stragglers 3—and
whether sperm or right. The sheets are numbered letter F of the serieS.

Lieut. Herndon was interrupted in these highly interesting investigationS, by orders for sea service. He
had proceeded sar enough however with the charts to develop some of the first fruitS, which it might be ex·
pected, are concealed in a field so abundant with treasures as this may be well supposed to be. But these

orders deprived me os the assistance of a most valuable officer, and greatly delayed the work.
