Farm situated between the Miami rivers. There are no mountainsnearer than the cumberland a
Alleghany3 the one lying in a southeast direction, and the other east of this locality. The nearest point
these elevations is perhaps not short of 225 or 250 miles. Lake Erie‚ situated about 100 miles northeast
us, is the nearest sheet of water.

The fruits are appleS, pears, cher-ries, strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, quinces, a
peaoheS. Grapes also thrive well. The products of the soil are maize, wlueat, oats, flax, rye, and potato

Ι may observe that the cold South winds osten prevail through the winter3 and during the spring co
rather pieroing northwest winds frequently assail us; during the prevalence of which drought is almost si
to exist. Snow·storms generally come from the southwest‚ but occasionally we have a heavy storm of tl
kind from the East. To me it is obvious that the winda that bring us rain sweep through the great Mississip
and Ohio vallies in their course northeast. [That is, they are southwest winda]

Winds S. by W. bring the most rain, and W. N. W. the most storms3 the latter, however, are unsrequen
here, and very partial, owing, perhaps, to remoteness from the sea.
