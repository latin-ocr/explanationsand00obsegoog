Lieutenant Maury to Commodore McKeever.

N Arrouar. Onsenvarouv,

Washington, December 22, 1852.
“ Sta: Your obliging letter of lst October, with its inclosures touching deep-sea soundings, was received

yesterday, for which be pleased to accept my thankS‚ and to convey my acknowledgments to Lieutenant Parker.
1 am m‘ade happy by the interest which you and he take in the solution of the great physical problem concern·
ing the depths of the ocean.

The good work which has been done on board the “Congress’' with' the “ St. Mary's” twine, redounds still
more to the credit of Lieutenant Parker; for they of the “ St. Mary’s ” reported that they could make no use of.
it. That ship was absent nearly three years; she circumnavigated the globe3 was furnished with this twine
for the express purpose of sounding the deep sea. She made but one attempt ε that was a complete failure;
and then reported the twine as worthleSS‚ and that it would be useless to make any further attempts with it.

It is, therefore, not a little„ to the credit of Lieutenant Parker that he should take the twine which had
been condemned on board the ‘⁴ St. Mary’8‚” and do such good work with it in the “ Congress.’'

On board the “CongresS,'' Lieutenant Parker reports a sounding of 8,3oo fathoms, but discredits the result.
Ι agree with him that there is no evidence afforded by the patient labors of himself and boat’s crew on the oth
of April, that such is the depth of the ocean. The shot, no doubt, reached the bottom short of 3‚3oo fathomS.
Indeed, it is probable that it was on the bottom before the 2‚800 fathom mark passed out; for to this depth,
the running time for 500 fathoms corresponds with the running time for like depths reported by other officers

in other parts of the sea.

At this place of sounding there was an under current3 for, by the action os it upon the line alone, it towed
Lieutenant Parker’s boat against a surface current, and the “ at the rate of about one knot per hour.” Speaking
of this under current again, and aster he had returned on board the frigate, Lieutenant Parker shows it to be very
decided 3 “For whilst,'' says he, “the ship’s reckoning gave a surface drift, by current and other causes, os
nearly one mile per hour S. S. E„ for the 24 hours which included our nine hours time, our boat was dragged
at the rate of nearly, sometimes fully, a knot and a half per hour, invariably toward the northward and west-
ward whenever the line was checked.'’

1 should have been able to discuss this sounding in a much more conclusive way had each 100 fathom
, mark been timed. The time is all right by the 500 fathoms, and the sounding appears to be good to the depth
of about 2,800 or 3,000 fathoms· After that depth had been reached, the shot probably remained at the bot-
tom. The line then probably parted. Such is the result of experience with a great length of line out and the
reel checked. 1 have no case of any very deep sounding in which the line did not part within a minute or
two aster the reel was stopped.

Indeed, Lieutenant Parker himself affords testimony as to the immense strain that is brought upon a
great length of line, for he sayS, “ Four men could haul in but 100 fathoms in ten minutes. Aster getting
about 300 fathomS, the strain became exceedingly great, and, additional force being applied, the line parted

about 150 fathoms from the surface.’'
