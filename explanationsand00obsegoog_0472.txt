and S. Ε. tradeS, are much more steady and reliable than they are by the western route. Moreover, the dis-
tance from the Victoria ports, via south side os Van Dieman’s Land and New Zealand, is not more than three
or four hundred miles greater than it is by the most direct route that is practiczible‚ and the chauces of good
winde, by the eastern route, will, in my opinion, amply make up for this increased distance.

Itis proper for me to state here that I do not give these Australian sailing directions as directions that are
founded on or derived from investigations into the routes actually pursued by vessels from Australia to
California3 but I give them as deductions drawn from the knowledge which I have acquired touching the
general system of the winds and currents out upon the high seaS.

The most difficult and uncertain parts of this passage will be in the time required to cross the three belts
of calma, and to clear the winter sogs of California. But for these, the Eastern passage, from Victoria to
California, would be one of the most certain passages in the world.

The distance from Victoria to California cannot be accomplished under canvaSS, by the Eastern route,
much short of 8,700 miles· But driving CaptainS‚ with clipper ships under them, along this route, may
expect to average one trip with another, not far from 200 miles per day. The clipper rate from Victoria to Cape
Horu, will probably be upwards of 200 miles a day3 for 1 feel assured there is no part of the ocean in which
the winds generally will admit of more heavy dragging and constant driving than they will in the extra-tropi·
cal regions generally of the South Pacific‚ say on the polar side of 40⁰ S.

Returning from California to the gold fields ot Australia, the route out of San Francisc0‚ should be down

as soon as possible into the N. E. trades, as though you were bound to China‚ India, or the Sandwich Island3‚

.crossing the equator any· where between the meridians of 140ο and 150Ο west, according as you prefer to run

down your Westing‚ principally in the N. E. or S. E. tradeS. 1 give the preference to the latter generally,
because they are more steady, reliable and certain than are their congeners of the Northern Hemisphere—--

at least such is the rule. The distance by this route to Bass’ Straits will be about 7,5oo mileS‚ and an

increase upon this of the average distance to be sailed on the passage going, together with the distance

returning, will not amount, as before stated, to more than six or eight hundred miles,

Aim to cross 30Ο S. on the passage from California to Australia, in the neighborhood of 1700 E.

Thence, the course is between Australia and New Zealand direct sor your port.

In these passages as on the California routes generally, navigators have to cross the calms of Cancer and
of Capricorn, as well as those os the equator3 which last are found between the N. E. and S. E. trade wind8‚

but upon different paralleIS, according to the season of the year.

It may, therefore, be remarked, here once for an, and which remark navigators bound either from the U.
States or srom Panama to California, are requested to bear in mind, that the barometer will often enable the
navigator to tell when he has crossed these belts of calme, and entered the trades,

In the belt of equatorial calms there is an ascending col‘umn of air. All the atmosphere which the

N. E. and S. E. trades pour into this belt‚ rises up and fiows off by counter currents in the upper regionS.

of course, then, the mean height of the barometer in the equatorial calme, is less than its mean height in the
