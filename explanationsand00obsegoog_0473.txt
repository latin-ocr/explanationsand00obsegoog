trades on either side. This difference does not, probably, exceed one tenth of an inch (0.1 inch.) But close
attention to the barometer in and about these calmS, will often enable the navigator to decide whether the winds he
may have be really trade winds or not; sor after having been fighting these calmS, is you get the wind from
N. E. or S. E„ as the case may be, and the barometer rises, then you may be sure that you have the trades·

Ι have frequently, in the course of this work, had occasion to allude to the equatorial calms and the rains
which accompany them. In this day it is not sufficient to tell the navigator that things are so. He depends
more upon the lights of reason and the convictions of his understanding, less upon saith and the ipse dia-it of

philosophers than he used to do, And therefore, when facts and phenornena are now stated to him, his first

question generally is, sor the explanation of thern. Ῑ admire this spirit, and have frequently, in the pages of
this work, as I do now, turned aside to pay homage to it.

VVhere the two trade winds meet, they and the vapors which they bring ascend, and it is then “the rainy
season.”

1 have been permitted to copy from the meteorological Journal, kept for several years at Para, near the
mouth of tlie great river Amazon, by Mr. Dewey‚ an intelligent American merchant, which serves beautifully to
illustrate and to explain the phenomena of these rains in the equatorial calma.

’ Ι quote tables which Ι have had compiled from these observations, together with Dewev’s description of

Para, that the navigator, by studying them, may the better understand the remarks I have made and those I

have to offer.

 

From Dewey’s Meteorological Journal kept at Para from 1845, to June, 1849.
“ Latitude of the city of “ Santa Maria de Belem do Gram·Para,” south 1Ο 28’ ; Longitude from Greenwich,

west 480 29‘. Situated about 80 miles from the ocean, on the southern mouth of the river “Amazonas ;’' this
· mouth of the river beingcnmmonly called the “ Para ” river, but strictly a part of the great Amazon. The
breadth of the river at the city is about nine miles; and it' is studded with innumerable islands; the nearest of
which, called “ Ilha das OnaS,” directly opposite the city, is distant from it three miles. These islands form
a magnificent basin which is the harbor of Para. Great changes are constantly occurring in the river, old
shoals being washed way and new ones formed. A few years since, there‘existed an Island, a few miles below
the city, called “ Parroquet” Island—this has gone, and vessels of the largest burden can pass over the spot
where it once stood ; but, on the other side of the channel where vessels formerly passed, haS, within a few
years appeared a large island, already covered with trees of no small size, called “ Ilha Nova.'’ The tide rises
here about eleven feet. The country in this region is low and covered with magnificent sorests—indeed, the
entire province may be said to be an almost unbroken forest, with underwood of such density as to render a
passage utterly impossible, except by the foot·paths ot the nativeS. The birds of this region are of grea't
beauty‚ and for an Ornithologist‚ this province presents a field of unrivalled richneSS.

The water of the springs is unsurpassed by any in the world3 and that of the river is always perfectly

fresh except at high spring tides, when it becomes rather brackish. The water of the river is exceedingly·

muddy, but at low tide, springs of water aa pure as chrystal may be seen gushing from the sanda.
