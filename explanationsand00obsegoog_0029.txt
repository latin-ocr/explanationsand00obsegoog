A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM 01³· OBSERVATI'mS. 23

Extracts from “Instnaetions sor Taking Meteorological Observations‚-Drawi2 up by order qf tlte Inspector
General qs Fortifications, by captain Henry James, R. E„ F. R. S„ &am'
“A ‘notice’ of the arrangements which have been made sor having Meteorological Observations taken at the

principal foreign stations of the Royal EngineerS, has been published iu the corps papers for this year; this
‘ notice,' with some alterations and additions, is now printed as a separate paper, as instructions for the observers.

“ Since the publication of the ‘notice,' Major General Sir J. Burgoyne baS, with the sanction of the
Master General of the Ordnance, invited the co· operation ns the Honorable Board os Directors of the East India
Company, and the Board of Admiralty, for having similar observations taken in India at those places where the
Admiralty have officers competent for the duty, and where there are no other meteorological observatories ; and, in
consequence, the Board of Directors have ordered twenty sets of instruments to be sent to India, and the Admiralty
have ordered four sets to be sent to Ascension, Rio de J aneir0, Callao and Valparaiso. All the instruments are
of a similar construction, and will be compared with the standards at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich3 thus,
with the observations taken at different Government observatories, both at home and abroad, and by the mem-
bers of the Meteorological Society of London, who have provided themselves with similar instrumentS, and have
many zealous observers amongst their number—and with the observations taken in the different States of Europe
and America, under the patronage of their respective Governments—-and by Her Majesty's Consuls abroad, who
have been instructed by Lord Palmerston 10 caresully observe and accurately record atmospheric phenomena‚ to
determine the laum, by which storms and variable winds are generated, (see his Lordship’s letter and enclosures in
the appendix,†) that a greater combination has been effected for collecting accurate data connected with the
science of meteorology, than was ever before attempted. The observerS, therefore, are earnestly requested
zealously to perform their several parts, by regularly and caresully registering their observations‚ so as 10
make each set of observations as complete as possible, and thus to furnish accurate data sor determining the
laws os atmospheric phenomena‚ and the peculiarities of the climate of the different parts of the world.

- “ The following memorandum from the Inspector General of fortifications has been addressed to the com-
manding officers of Royal Engineers:

‘⁴ ‘It having been suggested to the Master·General that it might be highly useful to science if a series of
meteorological observations were recorded in different parts os the world, 00 000 uniform system, under instruc·
tions and by authority, his Lordship has consented that the object should be carried out at the nineteen stations

as enumerated below, by or under the immediate directions of the Commanding· Royal Engineers at each.
