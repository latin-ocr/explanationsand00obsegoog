and because the water rises or falls but very little durin‘g one or two hours before 3ηά aster the time of highest
water, a ship can depcnd upon it to find, during the whole interval between the given times, high water to
cross the bank.

Very osten the times of the highest water is 223 hours during the East monsoon (sun’s declination North)
or ,at 10} hours in the West monsoon (sun’s declination South.) This is also the case during the months in
which there are, with full and change, two tides, but the time of high water is ther. in general very irregular.
The same jumping of the time os high water during the quarters we observed in the Eastern entrance, from
noon to morning and backwardS, we find here in the Western entrance in the quarters of the months March,
April, Septembre 3ηά Octobre, but it is very difficult to point out the day in which 1t takes place. The great-
est rise above the depths os the chart is δὲ feet, with full and change in the months that there is only once a day
high water. The least rise with full and change near the equinox is 4 feet, in which months the change
ι takes place from high water in daytime to high water at night, and backwardS. When during this change the
moon is in the quartem, there is only one high water every day, and then the water rises 5 feet, in all the other
months it rises in the quarters 5} feet above the depths of the chart.

In March, April, Septembre and Octobre the water rises also in the quarters 1 soot higher, as with sun
and change, upon the Zeebank or in the Western entrance to Sourabaya.
