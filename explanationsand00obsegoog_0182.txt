Here, therefore, the American Navy has afforded to it a fine opportunity for solving one of the interesting
physical problems of the day, by ascertaining the depth and shape of the basin which holds the waters os the
Gulf of MexicO, and of the Carribean sea.

This problem is now, it is hoped, in a fair way of being solved at least so far as to enable us to form a
general idea not only as to the depths of this arm of the sea, but as to the depths os the ocean generally.-·-
Many valuable results have already been attained.

In searching for one thing in the domains of physics, we are often rewarded by finding others of more or
less value, which were not included in the original design. And so it has been here.

... The “ Albany,'' besides ascertaining the depth out in “ blue water'' of the Gulf os Mexico, will probably
ascertain also in what parts of it,under currents exist, and in what parts they do not; and this system ofrescarch
has already afforded grounds for the hope that it may lead also to the discovery of those secret channels through
which the general system of oceanic circulation is kept up.

The twine surnished the “ Albany'' sor this service, umortunately proved too weak. The best size and

the proper strength for the twine to be used were points which experiment alone could determine. That fur-
nished the “Albany” measured about 150 fathoms to the lb., and she bad 40,000 fathoms of it. It was

intended to be strong enough to bear a weight of 50 or 60 le.
And though the sailor resources and ingenuity os Capt. Platt and Lt. Wm. Rodgers Taylor, the executive

officer of the ship, finally overcome, in a great measure, as will appear from their reports, these difficultieS, yet
this could not be accomplished until a large portion os the twine bad been lost in experiment.

The twine when used for sounding was wound on a delicately constructed reel, which would turn with as
little friction and to the least force, possible. The usual sounding weight was a 32 lb. shot. When the shot
was cast overboard, it was allowed to take the line as fastas it would—as in heaving the log, the chip is allowed
to take the line 3—and the time occupied by the shot in taking out the line was from the first carefully noted.

Now it is evident, the line being always of one size, and the weight a 32 lb. shot of the same (orm, that

these soundings and observations would soon afford ηρ the means of determining, with some degree ofapproxi-

mation at least, the law of descent which would govern a 32 lb. shot sinking in sea water, and drawing aster
it this particular line.

Having determined from the mean of a number of unexceptionable observations the law of the descent sor
still water, it would then be practicable, to determine in each instance, whether the sounding had been made
through an under current of water or not; and whether the shot had reached the bottom or not.

Suppose the sounding to be made through an under current—what would be the effect? After the shot
had passed through this current, this current would be operating upon the bight of the line: e. g., in towing
vessels when the bight of the tow-line gets in the water, every sailor knows how great is the power which
requires to get the line straight again.

In the case of the sounding line, the force exerted by the under current is a swigging force, and supposing

the shot to be stationary on the bottom, and the ship at rest on the top os the sea, the current will take the

twine off from the reel at double its own velocity nearly.
