The third trial was more successful. It has placed us where we are.
As, therefore, these chartS, so far, are the results of the joint labors of American navy officers and ship-

masterS, and as each one who has contributed to them, may be supposed to feel more or less interest in the
progr-ess of the work, as well as in the results obtained, it is proper that for th‘e satisfaction of those concerned‚
if for no other purpose, Ι should give an account somewhat in detail of the manner in which the work has been
conducted, and of the results, step by step, as they have been obtained and announced to the public.

The manner in which the investigations for each set of 'charts have been conducted, is fully explained in
another part of this paper3 and this will be readily understood by a reference to the plates and diagrams which
accompany this volume.

The results so far as they have appeared satisfactory and conclusive to my own mind, have for themost
part already been made public ; sometimes as official reports 3 sometimes in the shape of letters; sometimes
in public lectureS, or in scientific papers; and sometimes directly to mariners, as a notice in the newspapers.

I shall therefore recapitulate, as Ι go along, the substance of these announcements, occasionally presenting
the results first announced‚ not as they have since been modified, but as they appeared at the time ; so that those
who have helped to raise the structure to its present proportions, may have an opportunity of contemplating the
scaffolding also. They will thus be enabled to retrace the work, and to follow it in its progresS, step by step,
realizing as they advance how it is, that our views enlarge, and the horizon expands as we ascend from one fact
to another, and rise higher and higher as fact is traced to effect, and effect back to cause.

The first log books that were used in the construction of these Charts, not being kept with the view of
ever being so used, gave the winds generally, and especially when sailing free, as from the quadrant instead of
from the point of the compasS. '

Thus vessels on the homeward track from Ri0‚ after meeting the N. E. trades,.generally recorded the.
vinds as “ Northward and Epastwardst’ This induced me to suppose that the winds were from the N. Ε. point

of the compass, instead of the N. E. quadrant, and to infer, after the brushes by which the course and direction
are represented on the “ Track'' Charts were drawn, that these winds were for the most part fair winds for
going to the Equator also. ⁹

So understanding the entries in the Log‚ I saw that it was practicable fora vessel under canvass to sail
on a great circle from New York to Cape St. Roque in Brazil 3 I therefore recommended a more direct route
than had hitherto been pursued, auditis this route, which, with the additional information and the modifications
and exceptions which sub-sequent researches have enabled us to make with regard to it, has proved so short

and successful.

Seeing this defect in the old Log books, 3 form was prepared expressly for those navigators who were
volunteering to ‹zo-operate with me. In this form they are requested particularly, always to note the point of
the compass from which the wind comes; and when it is variable, to note and enter, at the time, the point of

the compass from which it may have most prevailed, during each of the “ three parts’' into which mariners are

accustomed to divide the 24 hours. When a navigator soils to dothis, Ιιε retum to me a useless Log.
