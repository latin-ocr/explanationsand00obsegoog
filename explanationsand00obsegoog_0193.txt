“ At 5 P. M. being about 3 miles from the first position we got bottom with 720 fathoms, the line being
eight minutes in running out. Lat. 220 32’ Ν., Long. chro. 840 32’ W. Waxed line.

“January astla, 1851.—Sailed from Havana yesterday. Hove to at noon to·day, and got bottom with
470 fathoms3 waxed line ; time of running about six minutes3 Lat 240 05’ Ν., Long. 820 051 W. 3 temp. air
7803 temp. water 800.

“January 29th, 1851.—G0t bottom with 500 fathoms3 waxed line3 time of running about six minutes
and a hals3 Lat 240 37’ Ν., Long. 790 48¹ W.; temp. air. 7903 temp. water 790.

“We lost two shots in unsuccessful attemptS, the line having parted in both instances; once at 280

fathorns and once at 360 sathomS.

“Mem.-Deep soundings will, 1 think, always be attended with great uncertainty if there should be a
current. For as the shot descends its velocity decreaseS, and when its rate of running becomes equal to the

velocity of the current, it is obvious that you cannot tell whether it ison the bottom or not, as the line will

continue to go out at the same speed, indefinitely. Would it not? This idea suggested itself to me to-day3
being in the Florida stream. I expected to have got much deeper sounding‚ and was reflecting upon the un·
certainty attaching to them when my shot brought up and settled the question, as regards this case, beyond all
doubt.

“Januory soth <md 3lst.—-Blowing very fresh and a heavy sea running3 sounding impracticable. We
regret very much that we could not have got a cast in the Florida Stream‚ abreast os the Bahama Bank, near
its northern extremity. It would have been interesting to have compared it with the soundings of the soth.

“ We are making a glorious run. During the 24 hours ending at noon to-day we ran 260 miles, and since
noon (it is now 8 P. M.) we have averaged 12 knotS. You will receive oui· abstract in due time. The
. Captain is deeply interested in your various investigations. ,

“ February lst, 1851.—Blowing a fresh gale from N. Ε. which prevented us from sounding. During the Ἴ
24 hours ending at noon to·day, we ran 277 knots, and the observations put us still further on.

“ February 201, 1851.—Arrived at Cape Haytien in a fresh norther.

“February stt», 1851.—Sailed from Cape Haytien at 7 A. M. this day. At noon got soundings in a
calm3 depth 640 fathoms3 time of running 8 minutes 45 seconds. Position by bearing„Lat. 190 57’ N.
Long. 720 11¹ W„ temp. air 820; temp. water 820.

“ February wa, 1851.-Got a cast in the windward passage, midway between Cuba and San Doming03
the result is very uncertain owing to the drift of the ship. We got out 840 fathoms line, but could not tell
with any degree of accuracy the depth of the water, although the shot was, doubtless, upon the bottom. The

best results are obtained in calm weather, for then the soundings are perpendicular. But when the breeze is
at all fresh, it is impossible to keep the ship from drifting rapidly‚ and from falling off so as to gather headway
before she comesto again. In this way, if the shot should happen to strike the bottom as she begins to shoot
abead, many fathoms (perhaps a couple of hundred) might be paid out before she stops. Perhaps 1 make too
large an estimate. 1 suppose that something of the sort occurred wday, for there was so much slack line to
