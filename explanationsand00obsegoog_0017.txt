room appear alternating currents from the northeast and southwest‚ which change their direction as the Sun
passes the latitude of the place. On the Malabar coast, as the Sun approaches from the southward, clouds

and variable winds attend him, and his transit northward is in a weck or ten days followed by that furious
burst os thunder and tempest which heralds the rainy season. His southward transit is less distinctly marked3
it is the sign of approaching fair weather, and is also attended by thunder and storm. The alternating land
and sea-breezes are occasioned by the alternate heating and cooling of the soil, the temperature os the sea re·
maining nearly uniform. At present, when most powerfully felt, the earth by noon will often be found to have
attained a temperature of 1200, while the sea rarely rises above 800! The air, heated and expanded, os
course ascendS, and draws from the sea a fresh supply to fill its room z the current thus generated constitutes
the breeze. During the night the earth osten sinks to a temperature of 500 or 600, cooling the conterminous
air, and condensing in the form of dew, the moisture floating around. The sea is now from 150 to 200 warmer
than the earth—the greatest difference between the two existing at sunrise ; and in then rushes the air, and
draws off a current from the shore.

‘⁴ We have not noticed the tide-s, which obedient to the Sun and M oon, daily convey two vast masses of water
round the globe, and which twice a month, rising to an unusual height, visit elevations which otherwise are
dry. During one half of the year the highest tides visit us by day, the other hals by night, and at Bombay,
at Springs, the depths of the two differ by two or three feet srom each other. The tides simply rise and sall in
the open ocean, to an elevation of two or three feet in all: along our shoreS, and up gulfs and estuarieS, they
sweep with the violence of a torrent, having a general range of ten or twelve feet—sometimes, as at Fundy
in Amerina, at Brest and Milford Havcn in Europe, to a height of from forty to sixty feet. They sweep our
shores from filth and purify our rivers and inletS, affording to the residents of our Islands and continents the
benefits os a bi-diurnal ablution‚ and giving a health and freshness and purity wherever they appear. Obedient

to the influence os bodies many millions of miles removed from them, their subjection is not the less com·-

plete τ the vast volume of water capable of crushing by its weight the most stupendous barriers that can be
opposed to it, and bearing on its bosom the navies of the world, impetuously rushing against our shores,
gently stops at a given line, and flows back again to its place when the word goes forth—'‘ thus far shalt thou
go, and no sarther ;’ and that which no human power or contrivance could have repelled, returns at its appoint-

ed time so regularly and surely, that the hour of its approach, and measure of its maSS, may be predicted with

unerring certainty centuries beforehand. The hurricanes which whirl with such fearful violence over the surface,
raising the waters of the sea to enormous elevations, and submerging coasts and islandS, attended as they are ’
by the fearful attributes of thunder and deluges of rain—seem requisite to deflagrate the noxious gases which
have accumulated—to commingle in one healthful mass the polluted elements of the air, and restore it fitted
for the ends designed sor it. It is with the ordinary, not with the exceptionable, operations we have at present

to deal, and the laws which rule the hurricane form themselves the subject of a treatise.
