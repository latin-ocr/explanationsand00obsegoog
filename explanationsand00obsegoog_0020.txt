the voyage hence to California has in consequence, of these researches been shortened to a more remarkable
extent. The average passage out by vessels not having the results of these researches to guide them is upwards
of 180 days ; but vessels with these charts on board have made it in 107, in 97, in 96, in 91 and even in 90

days; and their masterS, after making allowance for the improved models of their ships, ascribe this great
success to the information which they derived from these charts as to the winds and currents by the way.

The merchants and shipmasters of India, perceiving the great benefits which American commeroe and
American merchantS‚ shipmasters and owners, were deriving from this system of investigations as developed
in part only sor the Atlantic ocean, have promptly stepped sorward, raised a subscription for the purpose, and
directed a set of Wind and Current Charts upon the plan of these, to be undertaken sor the Indian ocean ; and
the Geographical Society os Bombay, composed os men eminent for their virtue and learning, has given the
undertaking its countenance.

After having spent much time and labor upon this undertaking, and after having made considerable pro·
gress with it, it came to the knowledge of the Society that I was very much in want of materials for “ wind
and Current Charts” for the Indian ocean. Therefore the Geographical Society of Bombay, with a spirit of
liberality and a degree of friendly consideration for which I am profoundly thankful, resolved to place at my

disposal all the work which has been accomplished under the auspices of the Society.
This work consists of track Charts of the Indian ocean extending from the Cape osGood Hope to 1700 E.

They are on the scale of the Wind and Current Charts. These MS. Charts are six in number, they have the
shore-line sketched in, and the tracks of one hundred vessels——in all colors—projected upon them.

The notes and explanations necessary to enable me to incorporate these charts with my own, however,
have not yet arrived.

The following extract is from the letter os Dr. Buist,a member of the Society, and one of the most devoted

friends of science to be found in any quarter of the globe.

“ Lumr. MAURY, National Observatory, Washington,

Mv Dalm Sm z—You will receive along with this, or shortly afterwardS, a tin case, through Smith, Elder
ἃ. Οο., containing the skeleton charts commenced by the Geographical Society, to which I have repeatedly
alluded, and with which 1 am now authorized to present you. We shall endeavor to do our best to provide
you with all the information we can collect to enable you to extend your researches to the India seas ; only
you must remember that while you belong to the sastest, we live in the slowest country in the world, and the
time we take to conduct a preliminary official correspondence suffices you for the commencement and com-
pletion of your work. I work here not only single-handed but with a world of obstacles actually thrown in my
way, with the labor of a daily paper on my shoulderS, a school of industry to attend to, and generally a severe
attack of sickness three or four times a year, so if I get on slowly it is not because of my doing little, but

because of my profession, by which Ι have exhausted four-fifths of my time and strength.
