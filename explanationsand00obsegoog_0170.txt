“From the last-named shoal γοα will proceed to a supposed submarine volcanic region of considerable

extent, between the equator and 3ο south latitude‚ and between 150 and 250 west longitude. Through all
parts of the ocean you will continue as you gc, the regular series of observations as to windS‚ currentS, tempe-
ratures, soundingS, δια, as per form of Abstract Log.

“In passing the region of equatorial calmS, you will again cross one of those atmospherical nodes under

which nice barometrical observations become of exceeding interest.

“After having satisfied yourself as to the characteristics with regard to depth and bottom in that part of the
ocean just alluded to as probably volcanic, γοα will proceed to make Cape St. Roque, bestowing unremitted
attention to the soundings and temperatures as γοα go.

“There seems to be reason to suppose that an under-current of warm water has its genesis in this part of
the ocean3 soundings and deep-sea temperatures across the Southern Atlantic may throw some light upon this
important question.

“Arriving off Cape St. Roque, and having put into some convenient port of Brazil for water, if necessary,
γοα will proceed to make a zig-zag course along the coast to the northward, for the purpose of investigating
the currents thence to the mouth of the Amazon. You will make stretches off from the coast of one hundred
mileS, or as far as it may be necessary, in order to cross and define the system of currents and counter·currents
that are supposed to prevail there, and a= correct knowledge of which is so essential to the speedy and safe nav·
igation of that part of the ocean.

“Having satisfied yourself as to those currentS‚ you will proceed homeward by the following route z—from
the equator in long. 370 W., draw a straight line to Cape CharleS. This line will lay nearly in the middle of
a strip of the ocean about 300 miles Broad,and which is remarkable for the temperature of its water. You will
sail a zig-zag course through this strip, crossing it at least four times on your way home, and passing the line
which γοα are directed to draw, at least two hundred miles on either side, and taking deep-sea soundings be-
fore you put about to recross it again. Should you discover anything remarkable as to the depth of the sea

within this region, you will push the discovery to a conclusion.

“It is expected that you will return to the United States some time in the month os April next.

“As the service on which you are engaged has forits object the making of observations and the collecting
of facts at sea, you will keep the sea during your absence as long as practicable.

“It is not expected that you will at all times be able to carry on without interruption the series of observa·
tions as here laid down for you. It is supposed that they will be interrupted from time to time by the weather
and other circumstances Much, therefore, must be left to your discretiori ; you understand the nature of the
service which is required, and are in possession of the views of the Department on the subject. The Depart-
ment therefore commits the service to you, feeling assured that you will in all cases exercise a sound discretion,

and so meet its just expectation8.”

Similar instructions have been given to Lieut. S. P. Las, commanding U. S. Brig Dolphin, now—May
1852-engaged upon the service which was assigned to the “Taney.'’ The complete results of his labors will

not probably be received from him in time for the present edition of this work.
