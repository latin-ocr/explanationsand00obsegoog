and in consequence of the advances which have been made since that day towards free trade, we have but to

suppose a decree ordaining that our ships, sailors, implementS, means, circumstances, and conditions os navi-
gation and commerce, should suddenly be reversed and become such as they were in 1740. The ruin that

would follow, would not only swamp merchants, but it would sit beavily upon governments and nations.

Currents qs the Sea.

In studying the system of oceanic circulation, I have found it necessary to set out with the very obvious
and simple principle, viz: that from whatever part of the ocean a current is found to run, to the same part a

current of equal volume is obliged to return.

Upon this principle is based the whole system of currents and counter·currents of the air as well as of
the water.*
It is not necessary to associate with oceanic currents the idea that they must of necessity, as on land, run

from a higher to a lower level.
So far from this being the case, some currents of the sea actually run up -hill‚ while others run on a level.
The Gulf Stream is of the first class. In a paper read before the N ational Institute in 1844, I showed

why the bottom of the Gulf Stream ought, theoretically‚ to be an inclined plane, running upwards. If the
Gulf Stream be 200 sathoms deep in the Florida Pass,† and but 100 fathoms off HatteraS, it is evident that the

bottom would be uplifted 100 fathoms within that distance ; and therefore, while the bottom of the Gulf Stream
runs unp-hill, the top preserves the water-level, or nearly so; for its banks are of sea-water, and being in the

ocean, are themselx es on a water-level.

’ The currents which run from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, and from the Indian ocean into the Red
sea, are the reverse of this, Herefthe bottom of the current is probably a water-level, and the top an inclined
plane, running down-hill.

Take the Red sea current as an illustration. That sea lies for the most part within a rainless and riverless
district. It may be compared to a long and narrow trough.

’ Being in a rainless district, the evaporation from it is immense ; none of the water thus taken up is re-

turned to it either by rivers or by the rains.
It is about 1000 miles long; it lies nearly North and South, and extends from latitude 120 or 13ο to the

parallel of 300 North.
1 am not able to state the daily rate of evaporation there ;‡ but it may be sasely assumed—and for the

illustration 1 will assume it-at the rate of two-tenths (Ο. 2 in.) of an inch a day.

1 1 learn from Johnston's beautiful Physical Atlas, that ‘⁴ from May to October, in the upper part of this sea, the water is two feet
lower than in the other months ;” and this he accounts for, by the wind which is said to prevail from the northward there, during this
