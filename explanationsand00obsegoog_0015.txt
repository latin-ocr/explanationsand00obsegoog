in the case of vapor carried off by dry air, at any temperatura that may be imagined, for down far below the
freezing point, evaporation proceeds uninterruptedly, or raised into steam by artificial means· The air, heated
and dried as it sweeps over the arid surface of the soil, drinks up ΒΥ day myriads of tons of moisture from the
sea—as much indeed as would, were no moisture restored to it, depress its whole sursace at the rate of
four feet annually over the sursace of thc *globe. The quantity of heat thus converted from a sensible or
perceptible, to an insensible or latent state, is almost incredible: The action equally goes on, and with the
like resultS, over the surface of the Earth, as over that of the sea, where there is moisture to be withdrawn.
But night, and the seasons of the year, come around, and the surplus temperature thus withdrawn and stored
away, at the time it might have proved superfluous or inconvenient, is reserved, and rendered back so soon as
it is required3 and the cold of night, and the rigor of winter, are modified by the heat given out at the point
of condensation, by dew, rain, hail, and snow.

“ There are, however, cases in which were the process of evaporation to go on without interruption and
without limit, that order and regularity might be disturbed which it is the great object of the Creator appar·
ently for an indefinite time to maintain, and in the arrangements sor equalizing temperature the equilibrium of
saltness be disturbed in certain portions of ⁴the sea, and that of moisture under ground in the warmer re·
. gions of the earth. To prevent this, checks and counterpoises interpose just as their services come to be re-
quired. It could scarcely be imagined that in such os our inland seas as were connected by a narrow strait with
the Ocean, and were thus cut off from free access to its waterS, the supply of fresh water which pours into them
from the rivers around would exactly supply the amount carried away by evaporation, Salt never rises in
steam, and it is the pure clement alone that is drawn off. we have in such cases as the Black and Baltic
seas an excess of supply over what is required, the surplus in the latter case flowing off through the Darda-
nelleS, in the former through the Great and Little Belts. The vapor withdrawn from the Mediterranean
exceeds by about a third the whole amount of fresh water poured into it; the difference is made up ΒΥ acurrent
through the straits of Gibraltar in the latter: and a similar arrangement, modified by circumstanceS, must
exist in all cases where circumstances are similar,—the supply of water rushing through the strait from the open
ocean being in exact proportion to the difference betwixt that provided from rain or by riverS, and that required
ΒΥ the affiux of vapor3 seas wholly isolated, such as the Caspian and the Dead sea, attain in course of time a
state of perfect equilibrium—their sursace becominglowered in level and diminished in area, till it becomes
exactly of the proper size to yield in vapor the whole waters poured in. The Dead Sea, before attaining this
condition of repose, has sunk thirteen hundred feet below the Mediterranean, the Caspian about one-fourth of
this. Lakes originally salt, and which to all appearance, are no more than fragments severed from the sea by
the earthquake or volcano, and which have no river or rain supplies whatever, in process of time dry up and
become a mass of rock salt in their former basin. Such is the formation in progress in the lake near Tadjurra,
nearly five hundred feet below the level of the sea, its waters having been thus much depressed by evaporation,
having now almost altogether vanished, one mass of salt remaining in their room. As it is clear in a case
such as that of the Mediterranean, that where salt water to a large extent was poured in and fresh water only
