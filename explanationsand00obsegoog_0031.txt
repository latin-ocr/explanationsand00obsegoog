Lieutenant Colonel[ Reid to Vilscount Palmerston.

14 Ksnsmcrou (ἴση, ‚april 15, 1851.
MY Lonn :—1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s letter, dated 20th March,
1851, transmitting to me certain documents on the subject of stormS. Ι have sent copies of the whole of them
to Μι·. Redfield‚ of New York, having asked the favor of the American Minister to transmit thern sor me, Ι
inclose herewith a copy of a letter, which Ι wrote to Mr. Lawrence on transmitting the second set of documentS,

with the answer which Ι have received in return.

I have no doubt that the representations of M r. Lawrence will have the effect of extending these combined
Meteorological ObservationS, hitherto confined to the North Atlantic ocean, to all other parts of the world
where American and British officers meet.

I venture to suggest to your Lordship‚ that a copy of the letter which‘Mr. Lawrence has addressed to me
be circulated among the British ConsuIS. Ι inclose also a copy of a circular letter, which was addressed by
Lord Glenelg, in 1838, to the Governors of all the British Colonies‚ which circular letter describes the manner
in which information on the subject of storms may be collected ; and which if your Lordship should think fit
⁸ also to transmit to the consuIS, it would serve as a very useful guide to them.

I must apologize to your Lordship for proposing to give so much trouble; but Ι do so from a conviction
that further knowledge of the atmospheric laws can only be obtained by interesting very many individuals in
the inquiry over extended portions of the globe.

Ι have, &a ,
(Sign‘ed) WM. Rem,
Meut. Colonel Royal Enginem.

{Inclusum—2]

Lieutenant Colone'l Reid to Mr. Abbott Lamence.
14 Knnsnmrou Gonu, April 10, lel.

Sm z—After l had sent to your Excellency, on the 3d instant, some documents on the subjectos Atlantic
stormS, I received the enclosed papers from the Foreign Office, sent to me hythe direction of Lord Palmerston.
As these particularly relate to a storm which Mr. W. C. Redfield has been tracing, Ι beg you will do me the
honor os transmitting them for that gentleman.

Ι take the liberty os informing your Excellency that the attention of the Governors of all British Colonies
has been long ago directed to the furtherance of the study of stemus, and that Lord Palmerston has directed
the attention of British Consuls to the same subject. More recently, an order has been given by the Ordnance'
DeparttnentS, to send meteorological instruments to the commanding engineers at all the British Colonia] staticus·
'l'he American and British people have an immense advantage in using the same language, which has enabled us
to trace the storm tracks from the West Indies to Labrador, and thus to make a great step in advance in

meteorological science.
