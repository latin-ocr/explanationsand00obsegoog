withstanding their mighty strength and size, of whales expiring in a moment after receiving their death
wound. Sometimes in apparent ssight-they use every effort to escape from their merciless assailants, and not
unfrequently in plunging into the depths of the sea and drawing all the lines from the boatS, succeed in doing so.

When a whale is taking line srom a boat, the utmost care is taken that it runs clear, as», should it become
entangled and not instantly cut, the boat and all it containS, would at once be drawn beneath the sea. Many
fatal accidents have 'occurred to whalers from being themselves entangled in the line, drawn from the boats and
seen no more. In order for the whale to get no more line than is absolutely necessary, a strong piece of wood
called a “ legger head '’ is firmly fixed near the boat's stern3 round this a turn or two of the line is taken, and
it flies so swiftly round, that its friction would set the logger head on fire, is water were not occasionally thrown
on the line.

Whales when attacked are generally passive, suffering the boat to approach, and the harpoons and lances
to pierce their huge bodies without making a' show os resistance, though serious accidents osten happen,
merely from the spontaneous movements of a wounded whale.

Boats in this way are often so badly stoven as to be rendered totally useleSS, and are abandoned on the
sea. But they are not all thus unresisting3 occasionally a large warrior whale is encountered, which proves
himself a formidable and dangerous antagonist3 that with a single blow of his ponderous tail severs the boat
from which he is assaulted quite into halves, often to the destruction of part of its crew. But the terrible
jaw of such a whale, set with a couple of 'score of large pointed tceth, constitutes his chief arm of defence,
and wo to the thing in the shape of a man or boat with which it comes in contact.

Naturalists in their closets often make ridiculous mistakes in describing animals that are ἰουηὲἰ in regions
and whale. “ Both want teellr for chewing, and
are obliged to live on inseets.” Again, “ the whale pursues no other animal; leads an inoffensive lise3 and
is harmless in proportion to his strength to do mischief.’‘—(Goldsmitlr’s Natural Hister-y.)

Sperm whales are not so gentle; the large males often encounter each other so furiously as to break off

where they never venture themselves.. Thus of the

 

many of their teeth when the jaws come in contact: and they have been taken with their jaws broken.

Instead os fleeing, a warrior of this mettle resolutely maintains his ground, and even in turn becomes the aa·
sailant, chewing in pieces every boat that approaches him. These desperate whales, after much hard fighting and
imminent danger, are sometimes conq uered; but so obstinately, and so successfully have they been known to
defend themselveS, that instances are on record, where all the boats of a ship, save one, to convey the dieuched
crews back, have been chewed into atomS, and the whales themselves, after defying all the resources of art,
and disdaining to flee, have been left in full possession of the field of battle. We have heard of more than one
case, where as a last resort, the ship herself has been run alongside of a whale like this, and while passing by,
lances were so skilfully thrown, that he ultimately died of his wounds, and became at last a prey to his captors.
But an attack in this way is certainly hazardous, as all will agree who remember the fate of the whale ship Essem·
