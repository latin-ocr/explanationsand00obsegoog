weight used for sounding, and the most glaring inconsistencies in the soundings themselves seem to have passed
by unnoticed. For instance: see the soundings os October loth, 1851, and January 28th, 1852, of 60
fathoms each3 yet in one case the time of descent is 8 minutes; in the other it is 11 minute83 so also the
sounding of J an. 16. Though the cast was but 345 fathomS, the time of running out is stated to be 15 minutes!
The time seems not to have been very accurately noted. The times are quoted thirteen timeS, eight of
which happen to be exactly even minume, and three are even five secondS. And there is little or no agree·

ment among them. How different is the case with the Albany. The soundings in that ship were taken with
the utmost care and they are discussed by Lieut. Taylor in a masterly manner. Qfficers are respectfully re·-

serred to his discussion of them, pp. 183 to 205, as a guide.

. “ On the 3lst December, 1851, iri Lat. 210 19¹ N.‚ and Long. 280 10‘ W„ at 2 Ρ. Μ., the weather being
favorable (perfectly calm‚) we commenced to get a deep sea sounding with the small line, 10,000 fathoms
in length, using one 32 pdr. shot.

At the first attempt to lower the shot to the water, the line parted. We then took three parts of the line
sor ten or twelve sathom8‚ and succeeded in lowering, the shot below the surface of the water, when the
line was allowed to run from the reel. The line ran out without interruption, from 2 Ρ. Μ. to 4 hours 44
minute8‚ P. M., making 2 hours and 44 minute8‚ taking out in that time 4,700 fathoms of line, during the
last hour the line ran out very slowly. The line during all this time was up and down, showing no current.
The ship during the period of sounding was persectly still. Not a breath of air stirring‚ and very little swell.

At 2 hours 44 minutes the line, running out very slowly, was stopped, aud we commenced reeling up. After

getting 25 or 30 fathomS, the line parted.
The temperature os the air being Ι780 ; water 790.”

soundings (with the line prepared for that purpose by the direction of the Bureau) in 3,000 fathoms water;

the time occupied by the line m running out, being l bour and 9 minuteS.

This was the only opportunity of obtaining deep sea sounding8‚ which occurred during our passage from'
