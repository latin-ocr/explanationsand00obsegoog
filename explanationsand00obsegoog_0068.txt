About this parallel of 300, tinen, these two particles meet, press against each other with the whole amount
of their motive power, produce a calm and an accumulation of atmosphere sufficient to balance the
pressure from the two winds North and South.

From under this bank of calmS‚ two surface currents of wind are ejected ι one towards the equator, as the
northeast trades—the other towards the pole, as the southwest passage winds—supposing that we are now
considering what takes place in the northern hemisphere only.

These winds come out at the lower surtace of the calm region, and consequently the place of the air borne .
away in this manner must be supplied, we may infer, by downward currents from the superincumbent air of
the calm region.

Like the case of a vessel os water which has two streams from opposite directions running in at the top
and two of equal capacity discharging in opposite directions at the bottom—the motion of the water in the
vessel would be downward ι so is the motion of the air in this calm zone.

The barometer, in this calm region, is said by Humboldt and others to stand higher than it does either to

the North or to the South of it; and this is another proof as to the banking up here of the atmosphere and
pressure from its downward motion.

Following our imaginary particle of air from the North across this calm belt we now feel it moving on
the surface of the Earth as the northeast trade wind, and as such it continues till it arrives near the equator,
where it meets a like hypothetical particle, which has blown as the southeast trade wind.

Here, at this equatorial place of meeting, there is another conflict of winds‚ and another calm region, for
a nortbeast and southeast wind canu-ot blow at the same time in the same place. The two particles have been
put in motion by the same power3 they meet with equal¹ force, and, therefore, at their place of meeting, are
stopped in their course. Here, therefore, there is also a calm belt.

Warmed by the heat of the Sun, and pressed on each side hythe whole force of the northeast and southeast
tradeS‚ these two hypothetica] particleS‚ taken as the type of the whole, ascend. This operation is the reverse of
that which took place at the other meeting near the parallel of 300.

This imaginary particle now returns to the upper regions of the atmosphere again, and travels there until
it meet8‚ near the calm beltos Cancer, its sellow particle from the North, where it descends as before, and con·
tinues to flow towards the pole as a surface wind srom southwest.

Entering the polar regions obliquely‚ it is pressed upon by similar currents coming from every meridian3
here our imaginat-y particle approaches the higher parallels more and more obliquely‚ until it, with all the rest,
is whirled about the pole in a continued circular gale ε finally reaching the vortex, it is carried upwards to the
regions of atmosphere above, whence it commences again its circuit to the South as an upper current.

Now the course we have imagined an atom of air to take is this: (Plate II) an ascent at P, at the North
pole3 an efflux thence as an upper current, until it meets G, (also an upper current,) over the calms of Cancer.

Here there is supposed to be a descent, as' shown by the arrows along the wavy lines which envelope the circle.

This upper current srom the pole now becomes the N. E. trade wind B, on the surface, it rises up at the equator,
