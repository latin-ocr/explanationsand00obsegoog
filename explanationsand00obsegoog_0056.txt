state of our information· with regard to the currents of the sea, urged the value of what was locked up in the old sea
chests of matinen-S, and pressed the importance to science, commerce‚ and navigation, of the information which
navigators might give were they enlisted ina common plan of‘observation concerning the phenomena of the ocean.

These institutions expressed an interest in the matter, and resolved to second my efforts by appointinga

committee to presa the subject upon the attention of the Government. The Hon. Jno. Y. Mason, then Secre-

tary of the Navy, heartily seconded the plan, and did as his successors have done, much towards its advance-

ment and progress.
In the mean time I obtained the assistance of Lieut. Wm. Β. Whiting, United States Navy, a most«

accomplished draftsman and hydrographer.-· He was ordered to report for duty at this office in 1845.

The labor was commenced anew ; more Lug-books had been procured froin our men-of·war. It was now
seen that we should obtain more and better materiale than we had before z all the former work was therefore
rubbed ont, arrd we began anew.

But our men-oswiu seldom went to England or the north os Europe, therefore nothing was to be done
in that quar-ter. The direction in which they most cruised was South of the parallel of 400 North,

The beginning of 1848, found three sheets-——those which correspond to Nos· 1, 2, and 3 of the present
Track charta, series A, North Atlantia—engraved and published.

They contained only the tracks of men-of-war, but though there were few of these, I was satisfied that the
work, so sar, enabled me to point out a shorter and a quicker, and a better route to Rio than the one usually
pursued. This was a discovery, as far as the great body of navigators was concerned ; and as such I announced
it. The batque W. H. D. C. Wright, J ackson, of Baltimore, was the first to try this new route. She crossed
the Line in Longitude 31ο West, the 24th day out, (it has since been done in 18 days, the usual time before -
was 41 days,) and made the trip to Rio and back, in 75 dayS. A remarkable quiek voyage it was, and a
complete demonstration of the problem that 1 had so long endeavored to prove.

Navigators now appeared for the first time to comprehend clearly what it was I wanted them to ἀτη

they appreciated the importance of the undertaking, and carne for-ward readily with offers of hearty, zealous

and gratuitous <zo-operation.

In a short time a large fleet, without the promise or hope of reward, was found zealously co-operating
with me, each one engaged in collecting, according to the same plan, materials for the work3 more than a
thousand navigatore are now busied night and day in all parts os the world, in making observations and gratui-
tously collecting materials of great value to science, commerce and navigation; never before has there been
such a corps of observers scattered over the world, yetlaboring together and acting in concert, with regard to

any system or subject of philosophical research.
This fact speaks volumes in favor of the intelligence and public spirit of American navigatorS, and as a

sailor 1 mention it with proud satisfaction.
Bein‘g now fairly under way with new and more abundant materiaIS, and having the assistance of such a

large, able, a'nd zealous corps of observers in collecting more, it was again found necessary to rub out and

begin afresh with the charte.
