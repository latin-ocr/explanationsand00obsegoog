Column 7, shows the average per centage of winds that are dead abead.

Column 11, shows the average per centage of calms sor each district os 50 square through which the

course in column 3, leads.
Column 12, shows the number of observations from which the figures in the other columns, and the

courses recommended, have been obtained.
When the winds are fair, and the vessel is near the route recommended, she should steer straight from d

to d, instead of making a zigzag· track as by the projection.
The letter w, where it appears in column 8 or 9, means that that side is the windward side. But it is not

The letter e, in the column of calms means that this part of the route is through the region of calms that

border the northeast trade winda, North and South, or that that part os the ocean is peculial-ly liable to

calm—(See Trade Wiud Chart.)
