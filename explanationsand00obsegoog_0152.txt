were also other indications that it had been the camping ground os some civilized traveling or hunting party;

our speculations at once connected them with the object of ou'r search.

While making our researches on shore, the vessel was set by a strong current near the point, where, be·

‘ coming hampered by some masses of ice, she took the ground. Every effort was made to get her off, but the

falling tide soon left her “ hard and fast.'’ We now lightened her of all weighty articles about deck, and pre·
pared to renew our efforts when the tide should rise. This took place about midnight, when she was hauled
off without apparent injury.

The Prince Albert approached fis while aground, and Commander F orsyth tendered his assistance3 it
was not, however, required. Soon after, the Rescue came in sight from around Beechy island, and making
us out in our predicament, hove to in the offing and sent a boat in. She had been up Wellington Channel as
far as Point Iunes, The condition of the ice prevented her from reaching Cape Hotham, (the appointed place
of rendezvous) so she had returned in search of us. ι

On the 26th, with a light breeze, we passed Beechy island, and ran through a narrow lead to the north.

Immediately above Point InneS, the ice of Wellington Channel was fixed and unbroken from shore to shore

and had every indication of having so remained for at least two or three yearS. It was generally about eight
feet thick, and the sharp angular hummocks—peculiar to recently formed ice—had been rounded down to gen·
tle hillockS, by the action of the weather for several seasons. Farther progress to the north was out of the
question. To the west, however, along the edge of the fixed ice, a lead presented itself, with a freshening
wind from the southeast. We ran into it; but at half way across the channel, our headway was arrested by
the closing ice. A few miles beyond this, two of the English vessels (one a steamer) were dangerously be·
set. Ι deem ed it prudent to return to Point InneS, under the lee of which, the vessels might hold to in se·
curity until a favorable change should take place.

On Point Inues, distinct traces of an encampment were found, together with many relies similar to those

found at Cape Riley. ⁹ Captain Penny (whose squadrcn we met here) picked up a piece of paper containing

the name of one of the officers of Franklin's expedition, written' in pencil; thus proving beyond a doubt that
some of his party had encamped here3 but when or under what circumstanceS, it was difficult to say. The
preserved meat-canS, moreover, bore the name of the person who had supplied his ships with that article.

On Point Innes we also found the remains of an Esquimaux hut, but it had evidently been abandoned
for many years, No recent traces of this people were found on any of the shores of Lancaster sound‚ that
we visited. The weather becoming more favorable, we retraced our steps as far as Beechy island, in order to
make more minute investigations in that quarter. The vessels were made fast to the land-ice on the northwest
side of the island, on the 27th of August. The schooner Felix, Captain Sir John Ross, R. N., and the
squadron under Captain Penny, joined us at this point. Consulting with these gentlemen, a joint search was
instituted along the adjacent shore, in all directions. In a short time one of Captain Penny’s men returned,
and reported that he had discovered several graves. On examination, his report proved to be correct. Three

well made graves were found, with painted head-boards of wood3 the inscriptions on which were as follows ε
