they will transmit the results of them to the Hydrographer’s Office os the Admiralty, where an adequate staff
of officers or others should be provided for their prompt examination, aud the publication of the improved
charts and sailing directions to which they would lead3 above all, it seems desirable to establish a prompt com-
munication with the Hydrographer’s Office of the United States, so that the united labors os the two greatest
naval and commercia] nations of the world may be combined, with the least practicable delay, in promoting
the interests os navigation.

‘⁸ The President and Council refer to the documents which have been submitted to them, and more espe-
cially to the ‘ Explanations and Sailing Directions to accompany wind and current charts’ prepared by Lieu-
tenant Maury, for a more detailed account of this system of cofoperative observations, and of the grounds

upon which they have ventured· to make the preceding recommendation8.’'

Report of Lieutenant Mam-y to the &cretam of the Navy.
Nati-ronan Ossnnvxronv, Washingion, November eth, 1852.

Srn z—By a communication of December eth, 1851, from the N avy Department, I was instructed to confer
with Her Britannic Majesty's officers and others, with regard to the *establishment of a universal system of
meteorological observations. I was directed also to report progress from timeto time to the N avy Department.
This 1 now have the honor to do.

That no time might be lost with regard to a measure that gives promise of such universal benefits, Ι
immediately published a pamphlet in explanation of.the proposition'and of the steps which had been taken
with regard to it.

A copy of this pamphlet entitled “ On the establishment os a universal system of meteorological observa·
tions by sea and land,” 1 have the honor herewith to sorward.

Steps were taken to bring the subject to the notice of the various Governments with which the United

States were in friendly and diplomatic intercourse. To this end, Ministers and Diplomatic Agents were ad-
dressed, requesting them to bring the subject to the notice of the proper {unctionaries abroad‚ and to convey
an invitation for comper-ation-

The main object of this plan of meteorological observationS, so far as the a'im which the United States
had especially in view is concerned, was to bring the sea regularly within the domain of active and systematic
meteorological research, and make it a field in which maritime nations might all act together and in concert for
the common good of mankind.

This proposition was offered as an amendment to one lrom Great Britain, inviting the co·operation of the
United States in an arrangement ‘⁴ for the purpose of enabling the officere of the Royal Engineers at foreign
staticus to take meteorological observations upon an uniform plan.’'
