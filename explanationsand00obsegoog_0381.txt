noum ‘ro mo, Ere. 375

You will perceive 1 fell to the leeward of Cape st. Roque, yet 1 would again pursue your route, for Ι
still have confidence in the same. There were at the same time several other vessels much farther West than
myself‚ yet they made a sair passage into Rio de J aneiro. And 1 there heard os the shortest passage being
made by a vessel that made land several degrees West of that Cape.

It was my misfortune to have 140 passengers on board‚ my vessel only 240 tons, and to them I do
in a great measure attribute my not getting round sooner. They interferred much with my duty: protested
or remonstrated against my coasting along the shore. And often to prevent some dissatisfaction 1 stood sea-
ward out of sight of land, and consequently experienced a strong current.

of my passage from San Francisco to th1s port 1 have nothing to say, as you have the journal.

The diversity of opinion is such that no one pretends to give information or instruction for navigating
this coast. The prevailing opinion, however, is to coast along in sight of land at all seasons‚ is bound
southerly. And bound up the coast about as may vessels follow the coast along as there are os those that
stand well off the coast. It astonishes me, and also many others of my profession, to see how little is known
of the winds and currents in the North Pacific ocean.

In contrast with my long passage, Ι sorward herewith the extracts of some other vessels whose journals or
log books have fallen under my notice. Ι shall leave this port in about 7 days on my return passage to San
Francisco, and 1 there shall be most happy to hear from you, acknovvledging the receipt 'of this and also the

Journal. Should you write, please direct “ Care of E. E. Dunbar, Esq., San Francisco, California.’'
