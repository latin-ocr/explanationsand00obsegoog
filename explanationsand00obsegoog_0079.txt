We see light beginning to break upon us-—for we now begin to perceive why it is that the pro-
portions between the land and water were made as we find them in nature. If there had been more water
and less land, we should have had more rain, and vice versa; and then climates would have been different from
what they now are, and the inhabitants, neither animal nor vegetable, would have been as they are. And as
they are, that wise Being‚ wh0‚ in his kind Providence, so watches over and regards the things of this world
that he takes knowledge of the sparrow's fall, and numbers the very hairs of our head, doubtless designed them
to be.

In some parts of the earth the precipitation is greater than the evaporation3 thus, the amount of water
borne down by every river that runs into the sea may be considered as the excess of the precipitation over the
evaporation that takes place in the valley drained by that river.

In other parts of the earth the evaporation and precipitation are exactly equal‚ as in those inland basins
such as that in which the city of Mexico‚ Lake Titicaca, the Caspian Sea, etc.‚ etc„ are situated3 which basins
have no ocean drainage.

1f more rain fell in the valley of the Caspian than is evaporated from it, that sea would finally get full
and overflow the whole of that great basin. If less fell than is evaporated from it again, then that sea, in the
course of time, would dry up, and plants and animals would all perish there for the want of water,

In the sheets of water which we find distributed over that and every other inhabitable inland basin, we
see reservoirs or evaporating sut-faces just sufficient for the supply of that degree of moisture which is best
adapted to the well being of the plants and animals that people such basius,

In other parts of the Earth still, we find places, as the Desert of Sahara, in which neither evaporation nor
precipitation takes place, and in which we find neither plant nor animal.

In contemplating the system of terrestrial adaptations‚ these researches have taught me to regard the great
deserta of the Earth, as the Astronomer does the counterpoises to his telescope—though they be mere dead
weights, they are, nevertheleSS, necessary to make the balance complete, the adjustments of this machine per-
fect. These counterpoises give ease to the motions‚ stability to the performance‚ and accuracy to the workings
of the instrument. They are compensations.

Whenever 1 turn to contemplate the works of nature, 1 am struck with the admirable system of compen-
sation‚ with the beauty and nicety with 'which every department is poised by the others3 things and principles
are meted out in directions the most opposite, but in proportione so exactly balanced and nicely adjusted‚ that
results the most harmonicus are produced.

It is by the action of opposite and compensating forces that the Earth is kept in its orbit, and the stara

are held suspended in the azure vaults of Heaven3 and these forces are so exquisitely adjusted, that at the end
