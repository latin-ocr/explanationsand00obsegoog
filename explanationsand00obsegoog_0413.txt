os galeS. The temperatureof the sea had also suddenly fallen some 60 below the temperature os the air, is
indicated by the thermometer attached to the barometer in the cabin. The difference of temperature between
the air and the water continued with little variatim. until we passed the Cape, except a part of the 14th, 15th‚
and 16th of February, when we stood sar enough eastward to bring Faulkland Islands in a line with Cape

Horn. At those times the temperature of the sea rose to about the same range as the air; from that circum-

stance, in connection with the N. E. current, Ι was strongly impressed with the idea that a steady cold stream

set to the northward and eastward like the GulfStream on our coast, the elements being only reversed, which
would account sor the continual storms that seem to prevail in that region. ⁵

T he current continued more or less strong in proportion to the strength and duration of the gales3 but
varying more easterly as we drew up with the “ Horn,” until we were fairly past it, and nearly up with the
latitude of “ Cape Pilar,'’ amounting to no less than 650 miles ! Considering this great drawback in con‘nec·
tion with the almost constant adverse gales, many of which were so heavy that no ship could bear canvas8‚
it seems highly important to‘ ascertain the most desirable route, if possible, to avoid such serious dangers and
delayS. It was my intention to have doubled the Cape close, and keep near the land all the way round. But
after making “ Diegos,'' the violence of the gale seemed to render it a matter of prudence to keep an offing,

then there was difficulty in making northing without also making much easting. When we finally succeeded

’ in again attaining the latitude os the “ Horn,” the galea were not so furious but that we could carry close-

reef topsails. The second day after our departure from Diegos, the current had set us so far to the E„ I
could not believe my chronometer, and supposed 1 might have inadvertently stopped her lO', which 1 deducted
in order to make our position where I wished it to be. 1 continued to work time every day when an oppor-
tunity offered, and seldom missed a day, considering the dreadful weather. Arriving at “J uan Fernandez,'’
I found my chronometer perfectly correct, and have since corrected the longitude for the 10' subtracted.
I mention the above to show that you may rely upon my observations upon the currents, δια, with more
accuracy than is usually bestowed by merchantmen. Adverting to the winds of “Cape Horn,” Ι would
state that 1 projected wind circles like yours on the margin of your Chart of “ Tracks'' for the Cape.
The result led me to expect S. W. and N. W. as the prevailing winds for the months of February and
March3 but it was our hard fate to find them srom W. S. W. to W. N. W. per compass. I contemplate
making the voyage round via China. If so, shall continue the abstract with such remarks on the movement

of the elements and natural phenomena as may come within the range οἵ my observation.’'
