the undertow‚ we should have an uniform, or nearly an uniform, rate of going out. Let us, therefore, allow for
the stoppageS, and the drift of the boat by the unequal force of the wind aa best we may, we shall then

obtain the following tabular statement of this interesting day’s work. κ

At the leth mark, Lieut. Parker sayS, ⁴⁴ It was near sundown, and the breeze freshening.'’ This and'

the two stoppages can account for the 21 minutes at the thh time, as well as for that at the 13th.

During each of these times there was a breeze with drift. The observationS, therefore, appear to me to
be reconcilable‚ and such as to show that the depth of the ocean in Lat. 360 South, Long. 440 11' West, is
only about 2,600 sathoms as before stated. ⁴

1 think that after the above examination of the circumstances of the case, you will concur with Lieut.
Parker and myself as to the probability that the shot had reached the bottom by the time 3,000 fathoms had run

out. This conjecture has been made probably correct by a discussion of the rate at which the line was taken
from the boat. Other evidence, independent of this can be brought, tending to confirm the same. ⁶

Lieut. Parker states that the ship was dristed by a surface current “of nearly one mile per hour‚’' and that
the boat, whenever he held on to the line, “was dragged at the rate, nearly, sometimes fully, a knot and a half
an hour.’'

I suppose it was through the water and not over the bottom that the boat was dragged at this rate, for an
under current os Ξ miles per hour, operating upon the great length of line out, might tow the boat through the
water at nearly a knot and a half an hour, provided there were a counter surface current, as in this case there
was, of aboth knots per hour,

1 may remark in passing, that a further account as to the circumstances connected with this under current

would have greatly enhanced the value of this interesting day’s work.
