ln entering into Bhering's stratis and following up the coast of West Georgia, the whalers may make
icy barrier perhaps about 1600 W. between Lat. 700 and 720 N. In this position they will find themsel·
in a straight line, not more than a thousand miles srom Wellington Straits on the Atlantic shores of Amet
and not much more than half that distance from Bank's Land. To the N. E. of this land are the Parry Islan
to the North of those the sea is by some thought to be again polynial or sree from ice.

In the Arctic ocean the prevailing winds are from the westward; so that a vessel under canvass enteri1
through Bhering’s straitS‚ would have probably a better chance of making her way through, than one w.
enters on this side and to leeward‚ and which therefore would have occasionally to turn to windward,
for much of her time, to contend against adverse currente».

To a vessel entering Bhering’s straitS, the current would also be favorable, for there must be curren

that sea to supply those which come down from Baffin’s Ray, into the Atlantic.
Ι These currents would materially assist the navigator in his progress Eastward through the Arctic seas.
they would retard him to the same extent in his progress West through the same seaS.

You are aware that there is a current from Baffin's Bay, through Davis’ Straits; this is a powersul cu
and it moves an immense volume of water. A current as powerful must run into that bay from some e
quarter.

Laden with icebergS, this Baffin’s Bay current meets the Gulf Stream near the Grand Banks where
bifurcated3 one fork continues as an under current towards the Caribbean Sea, and the other, pursuing its c«
to the South, is felt as an inshore current along the coast os the United States as sar down as Florida. There
counter current to this,· running back from the Atlantic through Davis' StraitS.

Wrangle's Polynia, to the North of Siberia, if it exist, probably owes its freedom from ice to the =
waters os the Guls stream, which run between Spitzbergen and the North Cape into the Arctic ocean.

such is the course os the Gulf Stream is clearly indicated by a thermal chart which is now in process of

struction at this office, by Lieut. Guantt. This chart shows that the waters of the Atlantic in Lat. 68
above Ireland, are some degrees warmer than they are near the shore off Cape Hatteras in Lat. 36ο N.
difference in temperature for the spring is 80 or 10Ο of Fahrenheit.

Seeing therefore that the-waters srom the Gulf of Mexico run into the Arctic Ocean to the North o
rope 3—that the waters of the larger rivers both of Europe, Asia and America‚ such as the Dwina, the Pet«
the Obi, the Yenesei and Lena, the Mackensie's river, the rivers of Back, the Copper Mine and σώετε,
into the same ocean 3—-that waters from the Pacific flow into it through Bebring's Straits 3—-that there is no
from it through any of‘these channels, but that there is a powersul loe-bearing current running from it th
Davis’ Straits 3-—seeing all this, we are led reasonably to inser not only that there is a sea not frozen some
between Behring's Straits and Baffin’s Ray, but that the course of the current in that sea is such as has a

been indicated, viz: from West to East.

The fact that these currents which run into the Arctic ocean and out os Baffin’s Bay, do exist, at
