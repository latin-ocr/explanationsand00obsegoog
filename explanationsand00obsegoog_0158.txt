To guard against the worst that could happen to uS‚ the destruction of the vesseIS, the boats were pre-
pared, and sledges built. Thirty days’ provisions were placed in them for all hands, together with tents and
blanket bags sor sleeping in. Resides this each man and officer had his knapsack‚ containing an extra suit
os clothes· These were all kept in readiness for use at a moments notice.

For the sake of wholesome exercise, as well as to innure the people to ice travelling‚ frequentexcursrons
were made with our laden sledgeS. The officers usually took the lead at the drag-rope8‚ and they, as well as
the men, underwent the labor of surmounting the rugged hummocks with great cheerfulness and zeal. Not·
withstanding the low temperatum, all hands usually returned in a profuse perspiration. We had also other
sources of exercise and amusement, such as the foot-ball, skating, sliding and cacing, with theatrical repre-
sentations on holidays and national anniversarie& These amusements were continued throughout the winter,
and contributed very materially to the cheerfulness and general good health of all hands,

The drift had set us gradually to the southeast until we were about five miles to the southwest ofBeechy
island. In this position we remained comparatively stationary about a week. We once more began to en
tertain a hope that we had become fixed sor the winter, but it proved a vain one; for on the last day of No-
vember a strong wind from the westward set in, with thick snowy weather. This wind created an immediate
movement in the ice; several fractures took place near uS, and many heavy hummocks were thrown up. The
flue in which our vessels were embedded was being rapidly encroached upon, so that we were in momentary

sear of the ice breaking from around them, and that they would be once more broken out, and lest to the ten·

der mercies of the crushing floes.

On the following day (the first of December,) the weatber cleared off, and the few hours os twiligbt

which we had about noon enabled us to get a glimpse of the land. As well as we could make it out, we ap-
peared to bo off Gascoigne inlet.

We were now clear os Wellington Channel, and in the fair way os Lancaster Sound‚ to be set either up or
down at the mercy of the prevailing winds and currentS. We were not long lest in doubt as to the direction
we had to pursue. The winds prevailed from the westward‚ and our drift was steady and rapid towards the
mouth of the sound.

⁶ The prospect before us was now anything but cheering. We were deprived os our last fond hope—that
of becoming fixed in some position whence operations could be carried on by means of travelling parties in the
spring. The vessels were being sast set out os the regions of research.

Nor was this our only source of uneasineSS. The line of our drift was from two to five miles from the
north shore; and whenever the moving ice met with any of the capeS, or projecting points of land, the ob·
struction would cause fractures in it, extending off tc, and sar beyond us·

Cape Hurd was the first and most prominent point ; we were but two miles from it on the 3d of Decem·
ber. Nearly all day the ice was both seen and heard to be in constant motion at no great distance from us.
In the evening a crack in our floe took place not more than twenty-five yar-ds ahead of the Advance. lt opened

in the course of the evening to the width of one hundred yardS.
