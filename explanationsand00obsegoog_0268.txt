which they are intended to cool. One has been found at the equator 200 miles broad, and 230 colder than
the surface water. Unless the land or shoals intervene, it no doubt comes down in a spiral curve. ⁴* ¹*
“What time rnore fit,—what occasion more suitable than the present, sor maturing a plan of operatium,
and for setting on foot a system of observations upon the Gulf Stream, and its kindred phenornena of the sea.”*
Thus, by a process ot' reasoning and argument, it was shown more than seven years ago that the Gulf
Stream, as sar as the Banks of Newfoundland, flows through a bed of cold water, which cold water persorms
to the warm the office of beriles to a river ;† and which “cold banks” thus pointed out, were discovered with
the deep-sea thermometer by Lieut. George M. Bache, U. S. N., in 1846, while operating in connection with
the Coast Survey. They partake so decidely of the character of banks of a river, that in the annual reports
of the Coast Survey sor 1846, and elsewhere, these banks were likened to a “cold wall ;'’ and by Lieut.

Bache in his report to the superintendent of the survey, to “a bank os cold water against which the Guls

Stream buts up.”‡
It was also theoretically shown that the Gulf Stream actually flows up hill :§

That its bottom is a bed of cold water: ΙΙ
