you cross the parallel of 100 N. in 300, or 310, or 320 W., and can make a South course good, don’t care to
go any sarther East. Of course, if you meet these southwest monsoonS, as in the summer and fall you will
sometimes do, even as far West as 320, you will in that case be compelled to obey the winds, and make
easting3 but when you are East of 300 always prefer the tack that will give you most southing, because it
will put you across the “ ‹loldrums‘’ soonest3 and if it bring you across no farther West than 310, or even
320, you may consider yourself in a good position, and clear of a region of light airs aad baffiing windS.

The average passage for the year by the “ middle'' route is 35 days; by the old it is 41 ; by the new 29.
Thus it will be perceived that those who attempt to “ split the difference'' between the old route and the new,
split it as completely with regard to time as they do with regard to distance.

-1.t.i}-l}⁰P‘?d that this‘exhibit, including everything that 1 have received with reg-ard to the Rio passage,
since the publication of the last edition of these Sailing DirectionS, will serve to convince the skeptical that
these charts are what they purport to be: i. e. the result of the experience of all the navigatorS, whose logs 1
could lay hand on for comparison, and that they are not based on am! theory of any body.

Some vessels are put down on the middle route, which did not intend to take it. They were forced

farther to the eastward before crossing the horse latitudeS, than they intended to go. They did the best they

'’³⁶‘I‘f1thefewpassages that come under this category had been so classed, the contrast in favor of the new
route would have been still more striking than it is-

The shortest passages to the Line made within the time included in the tableS, are, for the several
monthS, as follows: by the ‘⁴ Sea Serpent„ in March, 18 days; the “ Flying Fish'' in November, and the
“ Samuel Russell„ in December, 19 days each; the “ Maria„ in February, and the “ white Squall” in April,
21 days each3 the “ Flying Cloud'’ in June, in 22 days; the “ Black Squall’' in January, 24 days; the “ Isau

*“ Comet'' in October, each in 25 days·

The force engaged upon the Charts at the Observatory has been so much interrupted, that I have not yet,
had time to discuss the Cape Horn route, according to the method used for discussing the best routes to the
Line. Pilot Charts from 5008. to 6208„ and from 550 W. to 910 W., on a scale of 10 Lat. 20 Long.
have been published to aid navigators in their Cape Horn perplexitieS. A caresul study of these Charts is
necessary to' a proper knowledge of this passage. The first injunction therefore, in a set os Sailing Directions

for doubling Cape Horn is to consult, whenever the winds are adverse, the Cape Horu Pilot ChartS.

Vessels bound rou'nd the Cape, should first, however, after leaving Cape St. Roque, aim, if the winds
