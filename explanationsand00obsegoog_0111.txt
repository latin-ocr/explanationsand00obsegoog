compensation ready at hand t—so much of the cloud surface as may be requisite is then resolved into invisible
vapor, in the vessels whereof surplus heat from the Sun is stored away and held in the latent state until it is
called for3 when instantly it is se: free and becomes a visible and active agent in the grand design.

μ That the thermometer stands lower beneath this cloud belt than it does on either side of it, has not been
shewn, or if shewn, it has not yet been made to appear by actual observation, so far as my researches are con-

cerned3 for the observatione in my possession have not yet been dismissed concerning the temperature of the

air. But that the temperatur-e of the air at the surface under this cloud-ring is lower, is a theoretical deductiori
as susceptible os demonstration as is the rotation of the Earth on its axis. It is a well known fact. Indeed
nature herself has hung a thermometer under this cloud belt that is more perfect than any that man can
construet, and its indications are not to be mistaken.

Where do the vapors which form this cloud-ring and which are here condensed and poured down into
. the sea as rain, come from? They corne from the trade wind regions3 under the cloud-ring they-risa up 3 as
they rise up, they expand3 and as they expand, they grow cool; moreover, it requires no mercurial instrument
of human device, to satisfy us that the air which brings the vapor for these clouds, cannot take it up and let it
down at the same temperature. Precipitation and evaporation are the converse of each other} and the same air
cannot precipitate and evaporate, take up and let down water at one and the same temperature. As the tem·
perature of the air is raised, its capacity sor receiving and retaining water in the state of vapor is increased ;—as
the temperatura of the air is lessened, its capacity for retaining that moisture is diminished. These are physica!
laws ; and therefore when we see water dripping down from the atmosphere, we need no instrument to tell us that
the elasticity of the vapor so condensed, and falling in drops, is less than was its elasticity when it was taken up
from the surface of the ocean as water, and went up into the clouds as vapor.

Hence we infer, that when the vapors of sea water are condensed, the heat which was necessary to sustain
them id the vapor state, and which was borrowed from the ocean, is parted with 3 and that, therefore, they were
subjected in the act of condensation to a lower temperature than they were in the act of evaporation. This
is what is going on: ceaseless precipitation, under this cloud-ring· Evaporation under it is suspended almost
entirely the year round. It is formed by the meeting of the N. Ε. and S. Ε. trade winds. The vapor and the
air which they bring with them, here ascend 3 as they ascend they expend ς as they expend their temperature falls.
Hence we have, first a cloud and then precipitation. We know that the trade winds encircle the θαι-ὠς that

they blow perpetually3 that they come from the North and the South, and meet each other near the equator 3
therefore that this line of meeting extends around the world ; that in it, the air which the trade winds bring

ascends; and that in this ascent clouds are formed. By the rainy seasons of the Torrid Zone we can trace this
cloud-ring stretched like a girdle round about the earth.

In view of these facts, and of these laws, it is useless to consult the thermometer, merely to learn whether
the amosphere under this cloud-ring be warmer or cooler than that on either side of it. Our knowledge of the

laws of nature tells us that it is cooler.

In like manner, natur-ellim placed a thermometer on the sul-5303 of the land, and of the water, which tells us
