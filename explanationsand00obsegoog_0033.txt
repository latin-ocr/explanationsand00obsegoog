London, April 11, 1851.
Sin :—1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday, inclosing for Mr. Redfield

a report from Her Majesty’s Consul at St. Michael’s, of a storm in the Atlantic. I shall have great pleasure
in sorwarding these to Mr. Redfield, as before, through the Government at Washington, and 1 shall, in com-

pliance with your suggestion, invite its continued attention to this subject, as I am fully sensible of the
important results that may flow from observations vigorously prosecuted with the extended means the Mer·

cantile and Naval Marines and the Consular force of Great Britain and the United States afford.

I have, δια,
(Signed) ABBOTT LAWRENCE.

813 ε-Ῑ transmit to you a copy of a work lately published by Lieut. Col. Reid of the Royal EngineerS,

entitled “The law of StormS.” The object of the work is to develope, with a view to practical uses in
navigation, the laws by which storms and variable winds are governed. In order to make an inquiry of this
nature truly usesul, it is essential that the facts connected with such phenomena should be collected and
arranged over an extended surface, and that accurate records of them should be kept by persons whose educa-
tion and scientific or ‘professional avocations enable them to estimate the value of such records.

It has been suggested to me that such records could be most easily obtained, and the enquiries on which
Colonel Reid has entered be most advantageously followed up, by inviting the co-operation of captains of ports,
masters of light-houseS, harbor masters, and others, whose professional pursuits naturally lead to the observa-
tion of atmospheric phenomena.

A perusal of the enclosed work will convince you of the interest and importance of this inquiry, and I feel
assured that you will be anxious to do all in your power'for its promotion. ι

I would, therefore, request you to communicate with such officers or private individuals in the colony under
your Government, as may appear to you best qualified to furnish information on the subject, pointing out to
them the service which they would render to science, by keeping journals os such phenomena as may come
under their respective observationS.

The form in which such journals should be kept is suggested in the memorandum herewith enclosed.

1f you should succeed in Setting on foot a system of observationS, you will have the goodness to transmit

to her Majesty’s Gove'rnment, half yearly, an abstract of the journals at your command ; and Ι would suggest
