Now if the time occupied by each 100 fathoms in running out were to be noted at every sounding, we
should be furnished not only with the means of determining with some degree of probability, at what depth
this under current is encountered, but we should have the means of determining its velocity also ς 3ηά except
in those cases where the velocity of the current happens to be that of half the rate at which the shot was sink·
ing just before reaching the bottom, we shall likewise have data for determining what rates are due the shot
and what the current, and consequently whether bottom be reached or no.

Lieutenant Taylcu· has kindly promised when the new line, of which a fresh supply of 40,000 has been
ordered, reaches the “ Albany‚'' to have it marked at every 100 fathomS, and to note at every sounding, the
ti me it requires the shot to take out successively as it goes down, every 100 sathomS.

1 arn permitted by Commodore Warrington to quote Capt. Platt’s reports to him upon the subject of these

interesting experimenta.

December 18tl», 1850.

“ Sint—In conformity with your instructions, 1 have the honor to report the results of our attempts at

deep sea soundingS.

Ourfirst sounding, made with the line provided by the Department for that purpose, and a thirty-two
pound shot attached, was attempted on the eth of December, in lat. 380 38’ North, and long. 660 31¹ West,
both by dead reckoning. At this time, bottom* was found with 1,625 fathoms of line which ran out in 27

minutes.

On the 7th and 8th of December, the weather was too rough to admit of sounding.

On the 9th of December, being by dead reckoning in lat. 330 34' North, and long. 610 38’ West, we
found bottom* with 1,95o fathoms of line, running out in one hour and three minutes, with a drift of one mile.
On this day, six shots were lost in unsuccessful efforts, the line parting with the heaving of the ship. A bar
of imn, weighing 12 poundS, was also tried without succesS. The resultavas at last obtained by means of a

bar of lead, weighing 13 pounds.

On the loth os December, no sounding was attempted in consequence of the rough weather.

On the llth of December, our third and fourth soundings were effected. The former was taken in lati·
tude, by observation, 3Οο 05’ North, and longitude by chronometer, 580 12' West, with 1,ooo fathoms‘ of
line, running out in eleven minute-3. The latter sounding was made in observed latitude 290 58‘ North, and
longitude 580 48¹ West, with 1‚500· fathoms os line running out in twenty-eight minuteS. The former sound-
ing was effected under a light breeze, and the latter in a dead calm, during which the ship had no perceptible

drift. Eleven shots were expended before the soundings of this day were secured.
