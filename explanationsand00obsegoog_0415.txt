oF ‘rnre PASSAGE Anourm capa noan. 409

Ι had no opportunity to try, but am sure it is more governed by the wind than anything else, but far less than
· people in general suppose.

Schooner “Ohi0,'' W. H. Smyley‚ master, from Newport, R. 1.‚ to Rio Negro, Patagonia, sailed Sep-
tember 29211, 1842, in company with the “ Sarah Ann,’' Gough, master—consort to the “Chio’'—kept com·
pany until in 160 North 3ηά 400 West. Captain Gough, as well as Padack, wished to cross the line well to
eastward, and although they were both under my instructions and control, Ι permitted them to have their
choice. After leaving Captain Gough‚ 1 steered for Fernando do Noronha as before, but kept on until Ι found
myself in sight of Cape St. Roque, passing inside of the RocasseS‚ ten mileS, and by making a short tack off
Mananguapa, passed PernambucO, distant about eight mileS‚ being then out thirty days. 1 stopped three days
at San FranciscO, and three at Isapacaray‚ making my passage to Rio Negro in sixty days including stoppages.

“ The Sarah Ann” made no stoppages and came in ten days after me, making my passage sixteen days
shorter than herS, exclusive of being embayed two dayS. Ι found by overhauling their Journal and Log that
they kept well to the eastward in that old beaten tarnpilce of former navigators, crossing in from 240 to 250
W., and that most of my gaining was from about 40 N. to 80 S„ which convinced me of the advantages of the
western route.

Schooner ·‘ Ohio,’' first voyage, W. H. Smyley‚ master, sailed from Newport‚ R. 1.‚ J uly 14th‚ 1841—
making my passage in fifty dayS, including two days stoppage at the Brazils for recruitS. Ι passed so close
to the RocasseS, and not being able to get good observationS, owing to the weather, that I am not sure which
side Ι went on.

On my arrival in the BraziIS, Ι tried my chronometer by artificial horizon, and found it correct. It was in
the day time, andI kept a good look out for them, until 1 was sure 1 was to the South of them. This voyage '
1 had no consort ; I found bu't little current setting W. N. W., this was near the Βοο33333, perhaps one degree,
or a little more, North of them.

There is another thing still more remarkable : although you have more wind near the land, yet the 333 ἰ3
much smoother than it is further to the eastward. The natives who fish on the catamarans along the coast,
have repeatedly told me that the current was but trifling: you will often see two of these catamarans at anchor,
tail'mg in different directions, but generally with the wind. If the current about Cape St. Roque was as
strong as persons in general imagine it to be, the clump built coasters would not be able to make head way,

and beat from up to Pernambuco at all seasons of the year as they do.

 

Schooner “Catharine,’' of Newport, W. H. Smyley‚ master, bound to Patagouia. 1 left Newport,
September loth, 1845, and stood to sea, with the intention os taking my old route, that is, to steer for
Pernando do Noronha, or nearly that course, so as to pass East of the Bermudas, but the wind prevailing
moreto the South‚ gave me achance to keep well to the eastward3 Ι stood boldly on; but had the wind
ligh¹‚ with heavy rain squaIIS, and much thunder 3ηά lighting3 crossed the line in 230 32¹ making little
head way, having light airs and a very irregular sea. Although Ι found so much rain and light winds, the
sea did not seem to fall in the least, causing the vessel to thresh heavily, and be very uneasy. I spoke 3 brig

which had been eight days longer than myself in these rainy regions, and off Pernambuco I spoke one which had
