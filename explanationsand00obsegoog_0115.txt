“ Following the sinuosities of the coast, the Red sea shore is more than 4000 miles in extent from the
Straits of Babelmandeb round. Not one drop of water flows in from any of the countries on its shores, and
the nearest river to the Red sea is the Nile, which approaches it at Suez to within eighty miles, but retires
on the southward to four or five times this distance3 so that on the average there seems to be not less than
500 miles of the African side depending on the Red sea for a supply of vapor. On the Arabian side, the
arid expanse is of similarly ample dimensions; and in both cases, when a little rain does fall, at the interval of
years, it is nearly saturated with salt before it reaches the sea. The temperatur-e of the air betwixt Suez and
Adeo, often rises to 900, and probably averagoe little less than ’750 day and night, all the year round. The
surface of the sea varies in heat from 650 to 850, and the difference betwixt the wet and dry bulb thermome-
ters often amount to 250—in the kamsin or desert winds‚ to from 300 to 40ος the average evaporation at Aden
is about eight feet for the year, though the air on the Arabian promontory is, from April to August, nearly as
<lamp as at Bombay during the open periods of the monsoons.

“ Assuming the evaporation of the Red sea to be no greater than that of Aden, a sheet os water eight
feet thick, equal in area to the whole expanse of the sea, will be carried off annually in vapor3 or assuming the
Red sea to be 800 feet in depth at an average—and this most assuredly is more than double the fact—the
whole of it would be dried up were no water to enter from the ocean, in s00 years. The waters of the Red
sea, throughout, contains some four per cent. of salt by weight-or as salt is a half heavier than water, some
27 per cent. in bulk—or, in round numbers, say three per cent. In the course of three thousand years, on the
assumptions just made, the Red sea ought to have been one mass of solid salt.'’

The annual evaporation at Aden in the Red sea is quoted by Dr. Buist at 8 feet. According to the obser·
vations of Mr. Laidley, quoted in the same valuable transactione, the annual evaporation at Calcutta is 15
feet. Between the Cape and Calcutta it amounts to 3 feet 9 inches for October and Novembe13 and in the

Bay of Bengal it was found to exceed an inch a day, or at the rate of 30 feet and upwards the year. At Bom- ’

hay it is 72 inches.

Dr. Buist also tells us that the dew point of the winds which blow over the Red sea is frequently not less
than 30 or 40 degree· below the temperature of its water.

The evaporation, therefore, which goes on night and day, and all the year, from its waters near Suez, is
probably much more than 8 feet the year. It is probably not less than 18 feet; and if, therefore, it took the
waters which enter that sea through the Straits of Babelmandeb a year to flow up to the Isthmus of Suez.
it is evident that the level of this sea at the isthmus would be 18 feet below its level at the straits; for by the
supposition, 18 feet have been taken up into the clouds by evaporation from the surface, and borne away

by the winds. And now if we suppose merely for the convenience of illustration‚ the waters to be 36 feet
