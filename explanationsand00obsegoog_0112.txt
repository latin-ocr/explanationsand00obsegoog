that the· mean· temperature of the top of the earth's cmst, wheffier it be land or water, is higher than the mean
temperatum· of the snper-incumbent εἰη and so far as the researches connected with these chart-s have gone,

and bear upon the subject, they indicate that tt is so. Philosophus had already pointed to it as a probability,
and suggested it as a truth.

Where the atmosphere meets the land and venter, there is the greatest amount of heat on the Earth’s
surfaee. At this place of meeting, the thermometer in every latitude attains its maximum. Is we de·
seend below this place into the ocean, or rise above it into th'e air, the mer-cury in the thermometer is obser-ved

to sall.
The heating ταίγε of the Suu, a! they pass through the atmosphere, impart lime or none os their warmth

· to it. They must first strike the earth itself3 the caloric is then absorbed or reflected by the solid and fluid

pam of its cruet, and given to me air. The land and the water receive the beat from the Sun, and impart it
to the atmosphere zz-more subtle than they, it is aluo more mobile and expansible. The moment that that
stratum or layer os the atmosphericnl coating which envelopes the Barth, and which happens to be nearest to

irs cruet, receives from it the least accession ol· beat, that moment it expande, becomes lig-hter, and flies off
with ie to tae mn} veuit above. rt thu· givesplace ιο a coola layer, which in tum receives from the surroge-

anet fresh supplies of beat like the other, and conveys it away to the clouds. Thus, while the Sun is heating
both the lund and³ the water, the atmosphere is receiving beat from them. The sun heats them: and they, the
air.- Bu the laud and the cea do not give to the atmosphere al} the heat they receive from the San. They
radim off into 'poce a considerable portion of it. Hence we are entitled to infer, that the menn temperatur-e

off the upper stratum of earth and water, generally, issshigber thau the mean temperatur-e of the lower stratum

of the air.
Por particular locatitia and seasons there may be exceptione to this rule, as din-ing the long nights of the

pola! winter, when that portion of the Barth receives no heat from the Snn’s ray», and radiatos prosusely.

The Ferro lalanda, and places similarly situated, may also form exceptione to the nde. These islanda
ure surrounded by the πω wetere of the Gulr stream, and though standing in latitnrle 620 N„ the pondu·
there are said to mmain unfrozen all the winter. These islanda probably receive more caloris by conduction
from» the air, then by absorpiion from the Sun's rays, and the air which supplies them with warmth, derives it
stom ὼε water-s which have been heated in the inter-tropical regions os the Atlantia.

The-belt of equntorial calme and rains encircles the earth ; were the clouds which overhang this belt
luminum, and could they be seen by an observet from one of the planeta, they would present to him. an appear-
ance not unlike the rings of Saturn do to us. Such an observet would remark that thio cloud-ring of the Emh
has a motion contrary to that of the axis of our planet itself—-that while the Earth was revolving rapidly from
Weat to Eest, he would observo the cloud-ring to go slowly, but only relatively, from Bast to West. As the
vinds which bring the cloud vapor to this region os calms rise up with it, the Earth is slipping from under it;
and thus the cloud-ring, though really moving from West to East, with the Earth, goes relatively slower than

&hauh and would therefore appear 'to requirea longer time to· complete a revoluthn.
