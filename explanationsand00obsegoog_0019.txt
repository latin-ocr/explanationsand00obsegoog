1113 forest older than the flood‚ buried deep in the beart of Africa sar behind the mountains of the Moon. The
rain we 333 descending was thawed sor us out of the icebergs which have watched·the Polar Star for 3833,
and the lotus lillies have soaked up from the Nile and exhaled as vapor,'snows that rested 03 1113 3113113113 of
the Alps) ‘ The atmosphere,' says Maun, ‘ which forms the outer sursace of the habitable world, is a vast
reservoir‚ into which the supply os food designed for living creatures is thrown—or, in one word, it is itself the
sood in its simple form of all living 0133111133. The animal grinds down the fibre and the tissue of the plant,
or the nutritious store that has been laid up within its 03113, and 00313113 111333 into the substance of which its
own organs are composed. The plant acquires the organs and nutritious store thus yielded up as food to the
animal, from the invulnerable air surrounding it.’ But animals are furnished with the means of locomotion
and of seizure—-they can approach their food, and lay hold os 31111 swallow it; plants must await till their food
comes to them. No solid particles find access to their frames; the restless ambient air, which rushes past
them loaded with the carbon, the hydrogen, the oxygen, the water—everything they need 13 1113 3113113 of sup-
plies, is constantly at hand to minister to their 113313, 301 only to afford them food in due season, but in the
shape and sashion in which alone it can avail them.”

Surely a more tempting field for philosophica] research‚ sor usesul and honorable labor, or a field more
abounding with the elements of useful and practical 13311113, never engaged the attention of 111311.

ΒΥ studying the winds at 333 we might expect to find them blowing more conformably there than 011 1113

land to the general laws which govern the 0110111311011 os the atmosphere. And in endeavor-ing to learn these

lawS, we may look sor the 11113 31 sea: for the exceptione, 011 1113 131111. 11 might therefore be expected that

any undertaking to group the observations of mariners upon the winds in 311 113113 of the ocean, and at all

- seasons os the year would be regarded, as the illustrious Humboldt says this 13, and as the learned Dr. Buist

shows it 13, with no little interest by philosophers 31111 1111113311110111313, 11Υ 80011 and wise men in all conditions
os life, and in all parts of the world.

In the progress of this undertaking, many new facts of interest to science have been brought to
light, or their existence suggested. Our knowledge os the laws which govern the circulation of the atmos-
phere, which control the currents of the sea, which regulate 0111113133, 31111 11Υ which heat and moisture‚ clouds
and 3113311133, 313 11131111131311 over the sursace of the Eat-th, 1133 113311 considerably enlarged even by the results

so sar obtained.

Navigation has already reaped a rich reward from this undertaking, and commerce is profiting by it. In
consequence of the increase of knowledge which it has given to the practica] navigator, with regard to the
prevailing winds and currents of the sea, the average sailing passage between distant parts of the earth has
been materially shortened.

l’ractically‚ sor⁰commercial purposes, these investigations have listed up, as it were, the markets of the
southern hemisphere, and placed them nearer to our doors by several—and in some 03333, 11Υ many—days’ sail
111311 1113Υ were before ; for the time which it required a ship to carry a cargo from one hemisphere 10 another,

has been shortened more than two weeks at some seasons of the year ; and it is not going too sar to say that
