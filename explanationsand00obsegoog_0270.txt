it was inserted by them that this warm water comes from the Gulf Stream,—that it sent off a branch in the

direction of the Island of Bermuda. It was concluded‚ therefore, that here was a bifurcation of this stream.
In 1850, Lieut. Walsh, who was sent out in the U. S. schooner “ Taney,'’ to make certain observations

which Congress had authorized the Secretary os the Navy to have made, in connection with my researches
. concerning the winds and currents of the sea, found like layers or streaks of warm and cold water, and came
to a like conclusion as to this bifurcation or “ off-set’' of the Gulf Stream.

In a letter giving me an account of his cruise, which was unfortunately interrupted by his vessel proving
to be unseaworthy, he says : “ We discovered the hot wasers qf tlte Guff Stream extending as far East as 720
10', in alatitude so far South as 330 30’. The column of water temperature in the Abstract, from May 23
to 29, while engaged in tho search for Ashton Rock, will satisfy you of this interesting and important fact, for
you will notice that whenever we reached that longitude in our various tracks between the latitudes os 330 30¹
and 340 North, we experienced asudden change of as much as 50 and 60 in the surface temperature,—700 to
'760 z—this must be a branch or off-set from the Gulf Stream.'' This “ discovery’' is claimed by the Coast
Survey.

Now, these charte do not show that the temperature of the ocean between these parallels beyond the usual
limits of the Gulf Stream is permanently any higher than itis between the same p'arallels generally, until you ap·
proach the coast of Africa. The isotherms of 700 for each mouth, generally, after leaving the Gulf Stream,
stretch off to the Eastward‚ going up as high in some monthS, as the parallel of 450. Recrossing the parallel
of 400 North, between the meridiags of 150 a'nd 200 W.‚ they then make a sharp turn to the Southward and
Eastward, showing all the surface water between these lines and the equator to be permanently 700 and up
war-ds· It is not probable, therefore, that the Gulf Stream can supply such an extent of ocean with its warm
waters3 nbr is it clear that the warm water of the cool and warm streakS, reported as above, comes from the
G ulf of Mexioe. The cool water is probably the intruder from below 3 indeed, these charts have revealed 3
natural process of heating and cooling the surface of the ocean, which I am not aware has been discovered
before. It is exceedingly beautiful, and goes far to explain this phenomena of the streaks: when the rays of
the sun are operating with their greatest intensity in the northern hemisphere‚ they then raise the temperature
of the equatorial sursace ofthe ocean to the highest pitch. Its waters thus becoming lighter‚ flow to the north
in a gentle surface current of warm water3 and this current is probably too feeble to be detected by vessels in
the ordinary course of navigation.

Thus the isotherm of 800, for example, will pass from its extreme southern to its extreme northern decli-
nation—near 2,000 miles—in about three months.

Being now lest to the gradual process os cooling by evaporation‚ atmospherical comant, and radiation, it
occupies the other eight or nine months of the year, in slowly returning south to the parallel whence it corn·
menced to flow northward. How natural that in flowing north it should go in layers3 and⁶in cooling, that

some parts should cool faster than the others3 3180, that the cool water from below should now and then be

forced up through the mantle of warm water with which the heat has covered certain parts of the ocean. When
