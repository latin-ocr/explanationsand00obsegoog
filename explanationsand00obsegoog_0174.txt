The surface current was first tried by the usual mode (a heavy iron kettle being lowered from a boat to
the depth of 80 fathoms); then, for the trial of the under current, a large wip-lag, of the usual quadrantal
form, the arc of it measuring full sour feet, and heavily loaded with lead to make it sink and keep upright was
lowered by a light but strong cod-line to the depth of 126 fathomS, (the length of the line); a barrega was
attached as a float, a log-line fastened to this barrega, and the tate of motion of this float‚ as measured by this
log-line and the glaSS‚ and the direction as shown by a compasS‚ were assumed as the velocity and set of the
under-current. No allowance was made for the drag of the barrega, which was always in a different direction
from the surface current. It was wonderful, indeed, to see this barrega move off against wind and sea, and
surface current, at the rate of over one knot an bour, as was generally the case, audon one occasion as much as 13
knots, The men in the boat could not repress exclamations of surprise, for 1t really appeared as if some
monster of the deep had hold of the weight below and was walking off with it. Ι will cite from the Log seve-
ral instances of these experiments.

On May llth, in lat. 240 43’ Ν., long. 650 25’ W., we found a surface current of one -third knot per hour
setting to the West, and an under current, at the depth of 126 fathomS, of one knot, setting W. S. W.—tem·
perature of water at surface 77.30, at 50 fathoms 77.50, at 100 fathoms 73.50. The current felt by the vessel

on that day (as deduced from the comparison of the true positions obtained by astronomical observations and
chronometers, with those by the dead-reckoning) agreed with this trial of the surface current, being the same
within a fraction, viz: 0.3 knot, westerly. On this day, as noted in the “ Column of Remark8,’' the sea was
covered by a species of niedusae, of a dark·red color, spherical in shape, from one-eighth, to three-eighths inch
in diameter.

On May 12, at 4 Ρ. Μ., in lat. 250 55’ Ν., long. 640 43¹ W., the surface current was found to be §knot
setting N. N. E„ and the under current (at 126 fathoms) 13 knotS, setting S. E„ being the strong under cur·
rent I have alluded to: this was well ascertained by several trials—temperature of water at sursace 750, at 50
fathoms 760, and at 100 fathoms 690. From this time, 4 P. M. to 8 A. M.‚ the following morning, we expe·
rienced a strong current of 1.3 knot per honr, setting N. 140E.‚ as determined by the observationS. While try·
ing the currents in the boat, all hands remaining on board the schooner were employed sounding with 500
fathoms line, but failed to get the temperature at that depth, there being at the time too much swell.

On May 13th, at δὴ. 30m. P. M.‚ in lat. 260 42 Ν., long. 640 4’ W., the surface current was found to be
ᾖ knot setting Ε. by S., the under-current (at 128 fathoms) 14 knots setting W. S. W. ; at same time ob·
tained the following temperatures ι at surface 77 .50, at 50 fathoms 76.50‚ at 100 fathoms 74.50‚ at 500 fath·
oms 530. The current felt hythe schooner in the interval from 8 A. M. to 4 P. M.‚ was easterly 0.4 knot per
honr, agreeing with the trial in the boat. ’

On May 14th, in lat. 260 45’ Ν., long. 630 53’ W., found a slight surface dria, too small to be measured,
setting to the westward, and an under current (at 126 fathoms) os 1} knots, setting N. by Ε. No current bad
acted on the vessel for the preceding 16 hours, the dead-reckoning agreeing with the observationS.

On this day, the sea being pretty smooth, we tried soundings, and with the wire got 1,050 fathoms
