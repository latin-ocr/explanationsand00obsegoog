The thermal charts abound with beautiful results and instructive facts, all of which are expressed by the

charts themselves much more clearly and forcibly than my pen can utter them.

It is proposed to construet from the same journaIS, which have afforded the materials for these thermal
charts of the Atlantic, which journals give the temperature of the air, also another set of thermal charts which
shall relate to the temperature of the atmosphere over the ocean, though Professor Dove, by means os his valua·
ble thermal charts of the atmosphere, has rendered this labor much less interesting than in the absence of his
exquisite work it would have been ; for it has already been shown by this series of chartS, in connection with his,
that the remarkable bending of his isotherms as they enter the land along the western shores of Northern Europe
and America, is owing in a great degree to the manner in which the aqueous curves of equal temperature
approach those shoreS.

These charts will show very conclusively, and in a manner the most striking, that the mean temperature

of the ocean at the sursace is higher than that of the atmosphere.

The Track Gharts.

The charts numbered series A, are the “Track ChartS.’' Charts of this letter have been published sor the
North Atlantic, in eight large sheetS, for the South Atlantic, in six3 and for the west coast of America, in
four. The remaining 'number of this serieS, both for the Indian and Pacific‘oceanS, are in process of con-
struction. They are all on a scale of 0.8 in. to a degree at the Equator.

The different sheets of this series show at a glauce the frequented and unfrequented parts of the ocean ;
they inform the navigator as to the general character of, the wind and weather‚ the force and direction of the
currents encountered by those who have preceded him in the'same part of the ocean, and at the same season
of the year. ⁸

I have obtained* a list os arrivals at San Francisco from the Atlantic ports of the United States and Europe
up to the middle of December, 1850. Taking the shortest passage for each mouth by American, English,
French and Dutch vesseIS‚ we find that the American vessels which arrived there after the shortest passage in

May, June, J uly, September, November and December, had each these charts on board. Of the vessels thus
furnished‚ the shortest passage was by the Sea Witch in 97 dayS‚† the average of the six being 114 days.
The shortest of the other six which did not have the chat-ts was 119 dayS, and the average-128.
Mean average, taking the shortest passage only for each mouth :
For American vessels, 122 days.
