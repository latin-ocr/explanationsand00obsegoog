became the great commercial emporium and centra os exchange of the new world. All these results are
traceable to the use of the water thermometer at sea.

Other causes, doubtleSS, have operated to take away from Charleston her relative commercial importance—
but the primary cause was that discovery which removed Charleston from the way-side of commerce with
Europe, and which placed her on the outskirts of the great commercial thorcughfareS, and away from the
commanding position which she had before occupied. ⁵

In ’consequence of the improvements since made in navigation, ship building, etc„ a ship can now go
from New York to England, and back, in less time, than, when Charleston was the half-way house, she could
get to Charleston from London.

I therefore submit, whether this fact be not sufficient to turn the scales of commerce, and I claim the
result as one that is due to the influence of the GulfStream upon the course of trade, and the use os the water-
thermometer by mariners is the key to it all.

I have now in the process of construction at the National Observatory, a series of charts relating to
the thermal state of the ocean, that when completed, will give us more information with regard to the
temperature of that sea, than we now possess with regard to the temperature of any district on shore for one
tenth-part of the extent.

I have quoted in. the third edition of this work, but think it unnecessary to repeat it here, “ thefirst Log-
book of the ‘ catast on the voyage from Jamaica to Bria-tol, in Great Britain, 1748.'’ From it the mariner‚
the merchant, and the statesman, the political economist and the philosopher, may all draw instruction.

If this Log-book be a fair sample of the Log-books of that day, and there is no reason to suppose it other-
wise, the wonder is, not that the philosopher in arranging the different avocations of mankind, should have
been doubtful whether to class the mariner at sea with the living or the dead ; but that men should have been
found rash enough to become mariners at all, or merchants bold enough to make ventures abroad.

This voyage was performed without any other means of finding the way across the Atlantic, than such as

are afforded by the Log and Line.

It was performed under circumstances which forcibly remind one of the buccaneerS, the sea robberS, the
obstructions to commerce, and dangers to navigation, with which the ocean swarmed in those days. ‘ships
had then to sail in company, and beg convoy for protection. The speed os the fastest in the fleet was regula·
ted by the dullest sailer of them all ; and under such a state of things, naval architecture must needs be in a
rude state. The enterprising merchant had no inducement to incur the expense of building a fast sailing ship,
because her speed would be practically regulated by the snail’s pace of the dullest ship, and the most indolent
master in the convoy. The “ Celia,” ‘we may infer from the air of exultation with which when going 4 knotS,
the entry is made in the Log: “ ahead of all the fleet,” was at least a fair sailer sor her day 2 and the most
that they got out of the “ Celia” that voyage, was five knotS.

The better to appreciata the advantageS, which we of the present day enjoy, in consequence of so many

of the obstructions and trammels which settered commerce, having been stricken off from its various departmentS‚
