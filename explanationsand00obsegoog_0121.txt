ΟΝ THE GEoLochL acl-:Ner OF THE WINDS. 115

have been raised from the bottom of the sea: and, no doubt, the influence of such upheavals has been fielt in
‚remote regions by means of the windS, and the effects which a greater or less amount of moisture brought by.
them would produce.

In the case os the salt lake of Utah, we have an example os drainage that has been cut off, and an
illustration of the process by which nature equalizes tbe evaporation and precipitation. To do this, in this
instance, she is saltinguplhe basin which received the drainage of this inland water-shed. Here we have the
appearance, I am told, os an old channel by which the water used to flow from this basin to the sea. Supposing
there was such 3 time and such a water course, the water returned through it to the ocean was the amount by
which the precipitation used to exceed the evaporation over the whole extentos country drained through this,
now dry, bed of 3’ river. The winds have had something probably to do with this 2 they are the agents which
used to bring more moisture to this water-shed than they took away3 and they are the agents which nowcarry
off from that valley, more moisture than is brought to it, and which therefore are making a salt bed of places that
used to be covered by water. In like manner there is evidence that the Great American Lakes formerly had
a drainage with the Gulf of Mexico. Steamers have been actually known, in former years and in times of
ἱῐεὸὶιεῒε, to pass from the Mississippi over into the lakes· At low water the bed of a dry river can be traced
between them. Now the Salt lake-of Utah is to the southward and westward of our northernlake basin ; that
is the quarter whence the rain winds have been supposed to come. May not the same cause which l'essened
the precipitation or increased the evaporation in the Salt lake water-shed, have done the same for the water·-
shed of the Great American system of lakes? , ,

Jf the mountains to the West, the Sierra Nevada, stand higher now than they formerly did, and if the
&vinds which fed the salt lake valley with precipitation had, as Ι suppose they have, to pass the summits of
the mountainS, it is easy to perceive why the winds should not convey as, much vapor across them now, as they

did wherr· the summit of the ranges was lower and not so cool.·

The Andesffn the trade wind region os South America, stand up so-high'thatthe wind, in offida- ιο cm
thern, has ‚to part. with all its moisture; and consequently.there is, on the oth‘er side, a rainless region. Now
‘suppose a range of such mountains as these to b'e elevated across the traok of the winda which supply the
-Lake country with rains z it is easy to perceive how the whole country wateredby the ‘vapor which such winds

bring, would be converted into a rainless region.

1 have used these hypothetical cases to illustrate a position which any philosopher, who considers the
geological agency os the winds, may with propriety consult, when ,he is -told οἱ an inland basin, the water
⁴level of which it is evident was once higher than it now is; and that position is, that though the. evidences
·of a higher water level- he ⁴unmistalzeable and conclusive, it does not follow, therefore, that there has been a
‘ subsidenc'e of the lake basin itself, or an upheaval of the water-shed drained by it.
The cause which has produced‘this change of water, level, instead os being⁸ local and near, may be remoto:
it may have its seat in the obstructions which have been interposed iu some other quarter of the world 3 which
obstructions may prevent the winds from taking up, or from bearing off, their wanted supplies os moisture for

the region whose water level has been lowered.
