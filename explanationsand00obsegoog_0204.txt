The irregularities in the above table are very goeat‚‘but Ῐ have no reason to doubt the correctness of the

time, as it was noted by a very careful and experienced officer. To the four hundredth mark the line descended
perpendicularly, but after that the ship' was very unsteady‚ falling off and forging abead rapidly at timeS. We
have exerted all our ingenuity to keep her still, and the officers work the yardS, while lying to, with the
greatest care and watchfulness. I cannot speak too highly of the valuable co-operation that 1 receive from the
officers generally. They are all willing to do everything in their power to carry out successiully these experi-
ments. The Captain is a perfect enthusiast‚ and omits no opportunity of getting a cast, as this record plainly

shova.

At 4 P. M., being· in Lat. 27Ο 01’ Ν., Long. 74Ο 47’ W., 1 threw a bottle overboard‚ to try the current,

with a request upon a slip os paper it contained, that the finder would sorward it to you. I will continue to

do so from time to time.

This is the first accident that has happened to our new line. which proves to be of a very superior
quality. Its strength is quite sufficient to bear the unequal suain, caused by the rising os the ship to the swell.
It was a matter of great regret to all os us that this sounding was lost, as the line was perpendicular. A

breeze springing up, we concluded to deser another trial until evening.
