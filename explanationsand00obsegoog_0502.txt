becalmed, and had some difficulty in keeping clear of the “ Realm ;'' the tide was now setting strong to the S. W.
1 did not expect this, sor I had an impression that it always set through to the Northward. I have now no doubt
of their being regular tides through these straits, and no one should despair of a passage through. The tide rips,
taces and whirlpoolS, are ugly looking customers—quite equa} to those of the Pentland Frith, in Scotland.
These Straits should be surveyed hy one of our Government vessels, sor I have no doubt is the shores were
well known and by keeping close in, an eddy would be found, that would help a vessel through, even xu‘th
the tide against her, in the middle of the StraitS. On entering these Straits I should keep well over towards
the western shore, the wind being off, that is to say, from the westward. The “ Realm ’' being 6 miles astern,
when the wind hauled to S. W.‚ could not keep so far to windward ; the tide was now strong against us, but
was with the “ Realm,'' for she passed us rapidly about 3 miles to the leeward, and went ahead of us 4 miles;
-between the two ships, there was a racc or tide rip that fairly roared and extended North and South as far
as the eye could reach ; it had the appearance of a strong tide over rocks, Seeing the “ Realm '' had a fair
tide, -and we a head one, I bore up and crossed the race to the leeward3 in crossing it we were shaken
violently and whirled around in spite of helm and sails by rapid whirlpools. However‚ we had no sooner
crossed the race than we had a change in the tide, and we were soon up with the “ Realm.'’
