1150, both sor November and December, provided you do not cross 50Ο S., to the east of 880 or 900 W, lndeed‚
from June to November inclusive, better winds may be expected, especially in the Northern hemisphere‚ far

out to sea, than close in with the land. Theresore, while vessels from December to May or June, inclusive, will

· make better passages generally by crossing to the East os 1150 ; yet, for the other half of the year, they will do

 

better by crossing rather to the West of that meridian.
The average passage os 37 clipper ships which arrived at San Francisco from the Atlantic ports of the
United States between January 1, 1851, and April 1, 1852, was 124 dayS, the longest time being 170 days

via Valparaiso, made by the “ Eureka ;'’* and the shortest, in 89 days and 21 hours by the “ Flying Cloud’'
direct.

The next shortest was a little over 90 days by the “ Sword Fish,’' via Valparaiso 3 and the next longest
was 157 days by the “ Sea Nymph.''

Much of the information derived from these Charts bas of 'course been disseminated among navigators
generally, as may be supposed by 'the fact that the average passage of clippers to Calisornia, previous to 1851,

and of course previous to the general dissemination of such information, that sailed without the Charts, was
147 days·

The average of those that sailed with the Charts up to that time was 33 days less3 subsequent experi-

ence has increased this difference.
