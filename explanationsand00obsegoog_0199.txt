212—1722 lina—The weight of one thousand fathoms of the line is 83 poundS. The weight of one thou-

sand sathoms of the old line was 6 poundS.

3d-The Lenda—The leads are nine inches in circumference at the centre, and taper off to a point at each
end3 they are two feet in length and weigh upon an average 263 lb.

Near sunset this evening‚ (Dec. 2d,) being just in the entrance of the channel between Cuba and the great
Florida Reef, a short distance to the southward and westward of the Tortugas Bank, a sounding was taken,
which resulted in getting bottom with 1531* sathomS. Time os running 23 minutes 29 seconds, Lat 24Ο 25’

The following is the result of our first attempt at noting the descent of each hundred fathomS. 1 am not
very well satisfied with it, although I am* now thoroughly convinced of the entire practicability os our plan.

The reel contained at starting 9‚1oo fathoms of line, and the weight used was a 32 lb. shot.

Time of starting by watch, 4 hours 9·minutes 30 secondS.

The above table presents discrepancies that I cannot well account sor, but I send it to you just as it is,
and you can take it for whatever you may think it is worth. Perhaps the time was not noted with ac-
curacy, and I arn somewhat inclined to think that such was the case. But a part of the difficulty is due,
without any doubt, to the falling off and coming to of the ship ε as she gets a little headway‚ the line runs off
more rapidly than when she lies dead in the water, and the rate diminishes as she comes to. The time elapsed

between the 1 lth and 12th hundreds was 2 minutes 7 secondS, she was then perfectly motionleSS. But between
the 12th and l3th she had fallen off so as to fill the main topsail, which shot her ahead so as to take off that

hundred in l minute 35 secondS.

Thus, you perceive, we meet with difficulties at every step z—-the next question is, how are we to over-
come them? We had a moderate breeze and a smooth sea. The sail was reduced to topsails and spanker3
ure main topsail was square aback, and the mizen sharp aback. We find that we do better in this way, than
by keeping the mizen topsail full, since the stem-way that she gets now and then, tends to keep us nearly

abreast of the shot. With the mizen topsail full, and the main braced sharp aback, she will still fall off so as
to fill every thing‚—and we lose the advantage of the stem-board.
