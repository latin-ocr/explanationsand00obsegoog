latitudes than those in which the “ Sovereign of the Seas '’ found it, and therefore it has southing, and if
southing, probably easting 3130, in its course.

In like manner, the cold water into which this ship ran from the warm, we may, for like reasonS, suppose
to come from towards the polar regionS, and to be bound probably to the coast of Peru, there to seed that
remarkable current which was discovered by Humboldt, and which runs up as far as to the Gallapagos
IslandS, where it probably joins the equatorial current that flows west from the meridian of 1000 W. in the
torrid zone of the Pacific; and which, taking a sweep down towards the Society Island8‚ may complete the
circuit, and so seed the warm current of which Ι have been speaking. Is this cold current, in 450 or 50Ο οι·
550 South, an icc-bearing current?

Vessels bound around Cape Horn from any of the intertropical islands of the Pacific, should run south
through the Trades with topmast-studding saiIS, make sor the trade-like westerly winds of the South Pacific,
and with them run down for Cape Horn.

“ Permit me,” says Capt. McKay in his letter, ‘³ to suggest to you the necessity of some sailing directions
for homeward bound vessels, and especially from the Sandwich IslandS.

“A large and extensive carrying trade is opened to our ships, which will last as long as the polar
whales are to be had, as very many of the ships refit at the Islands, and send their oil home.

“ As to the partos the route from the Islands to the variables but little need be said, only to caution masters

against tryiug to make easting in the trade winds. The variable westerly winds are so positive, 3ηά the
degrees of longitude so short, that it is a great loss to keep a ship close hauled. Keep to the leeward of all

islands in the track, and give her a good full.

“If Ι had had a full crew, and a ship in full condition, Ι should have gone sarther south on a great

circle, and made a shorter run.''

 

And you would have gained by it. Moreover the advice, not to attempt easting in the trades, is good.
I cannot do better, in giving sailing directions for the voyage from the Sandwich Islands to the United

StateS, as Capt. McKay requests me to do, than quote from his abstract log of the “ Sovereign of the Seas,”

the track which that vessel made on her famous run thence to New York. Ι recommend it as a guide to others.
