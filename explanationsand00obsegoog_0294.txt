circulation, the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere would, in the process of ageS, probably become different

from that os the southern hemisphere.*

We have no reason to believe in the existence of any such change in the components of the atmosphere;

and 1 had almost said, therefore, in any such partial system of circulation.

On the other hand: if we maintain that the S. Ε. trade winds fiow North after ascending into the upper
regions of the atmosphere through the equatorial calmS, and that it is those winds‚ and not the N. E. trades
that in their circuit blow our S. W. passage winds; if, I say, we maintain this, we shall see the beautiful
adaptation for exposing them to the proper and wholesome vegetable agencies; our winter is the southern
summer: then the S. E. trades blow through the southern forests which are then in their stage of activity.

Arrived at the equator-properly prepared for the use of the inhabitants of the North temperate and srigid
zones—they ascend into the clouds; and, after reaching the parallel os 300 N.‚ they descend, and are then felt
as the vigorouS, wholesome, and healthful S. W. passage winds of the northern winter3 continuing on towards
the North frigid zone, they perform their office for the inhabitants of those inhospitable climateS, and approach-
ing the polar regions in spiraIS, they whirl continually around or about the pole in a direction contrary to that
of the hands of the watch.

Returning thence in the upper regions towards the South‚ as unfit sor further use, they are next felt on

the surface within or near the tropicS, where vegetation is again in activity, to fit thern for the inhabitants of
that region 3 'reaching the equatorial calmS, they ascend, and next appear on the surface in the South temperate

zone as the N. W. passage windS.

 

‘The extra-tropical regions of the North have much more land, and therefore it may‚be supposed many more organs than the South
to breathe. consume, and vitiate the atmosphere ; consequently in any given time, as in a northern winter, the demands upon the atmos-
phere are very unequal on opposite sides of the equator. On one side, the animal kingdom is exacting from it in excesu ; on the other—-

the southern summer—the vegetable.

Speaking in general terms, it may be said that man with his retinue of domestic animale, counts in the South but as one in a thous-
and to his hosts at the North. These myriads of warm-blooded animale in the northern hemisphere, with the fires kindled by man
in our winter, leave us to infer that more air is required for animal consumption and combustion on one side of the equator than on the
other, especially in the northern winter.

Th· air thus used, loses the proportione of gaseous combinations required to make it wholesome ; whence, therefore, is it purified ἓ
Not by the vegetation of the extra—tropica! North, certainly, sor its vegetation is then asleep.

But is we make this air return to the South by the route suggested, it will pass through the N. E. trade-wind regions, and be partly
replenished by the perpetually active vegetation there. Then rising in the equatorial calme, and overleaping, in the upper regions, the S.
E. trades, it descende to the surface in the extra-tropical South‚ where it is summer, and where the forces of vegetation are in their most
active operation.

Returning in the upper regions towards the North, still more refreshed from this part of its circuit, it first strikes the sur-face again
as the S. E. trades, where vegetation is again perpetually active. Being now completely purified, it rises up again in the equatorial calma,
overleaps in the upper regions, the N. E. trudes, and descende in the extra-tropical North, fresh with supplies in wholesome proportione

for breathing lungs and winter fires.

And thus, though we cannot tell the reason why this earth was provided with zones os perpetual summer, alternate winter and op-
posite seasons, we may nevertheless see through the atmosphere one of the purposes for which this arrangement ofsensione, combination
of elimenes, and proportion of vegetable surface was intended to subserve.

In this view we see room for the harmony of nature. We have not a single physical fact going to prove that such is not the course
of the circulation of the atmosphere about the surr-face of the earth ς but we have many facts and circumstances which, though they do not

prove, yet they suggest, that such is the course.

earth, with ¹1¹²st three lobes ε one in each of the trade wind regions, and one now st the North, now at the South‚ changing from one side
