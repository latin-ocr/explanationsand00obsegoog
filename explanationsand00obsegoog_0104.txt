“ These properties it carries into the atmosphere, so that the latter is, in reality, a magnetic medium, ever
“ varying, from the influence os natural circumstanceS, in its magnetic power. Is a mass of air be cooled, it
“bec'omes more paramagneti03 if heated, it becomes less paramagnetic, (or diamagnetic,) as compared with
“ the air in a mean, or normal condition.’'*

Now, is it not more than probable that here we have in the magnetism os the atmosphere that agent which
guides the air from the South through the calms of Capricorn, of the equatur, and of Cancer, and conducts it
into the North; that agent which causes the atmosphere with its vapors and infusoria to flow above the clouds
from one hemisphere into the other, and whose, {bot-prims had become so palpable?

With the lights which these discoveries cast, we see why that air, which has completed its circuit to the
whirl† about the Antarctic regions should then, according to the laws of magnetism, be repelled from the
South, and attracted by the opposite pole towards the North. ,

And =when the S. E. and the N. E. trade winds meet in the equatorial calms of the Pacific, would not
these magnetic forces be sufficient to determine the course of each current t—bringing the former with its
vapors os the southern hemisphere over into this by the courses already suggested?

This force and the heat of the sun, would propel it to the North. The diurnal rotation of the earth
propels it to the East3 consequently its course first through the upper regions of the atmosphere, and then on

the surface of the earth, after being conducted by this newly discovered agent across the calms of Cancer, would
be from the southward and westward to the northward and eastward.

These are the winds which, on their way to the North, from the South Pacific, would pass over the
Mississippi valley, and they appear to be the rain winds there. Whence then, if not from the trade wind
regions of the South Pacific‚ can the vapors for those rains come?

According to this conjecture, and not taking into account any exceptions produced hy the land and other
circumstances upon the general circulation os the atmosphere over the ocean, the S. E. trade winds which
reach the shores of Brazil near the parallel of Rio, and which blow thence for the most part over the land,
should be the winds which, in the general course os circulatim, would be carried towards northern Africa,
Spain, and the South of Europe.

They might carry with them the infusoria of Ehrenberg, but, according to his theory, they would be ο
wanting in molsture. Now, those portions of the old world are for the most part dry countrieS, receiving but
a small amount of precipitation.

Hence the general rule: these countries to the North of the calms of Cancer, which have large bodies
of land situated to the southward and westward os thern in the S. E. trade wind region os the Earth should
have a scanty supply of rain, and vice versa. ’

Now, the extra-tropical part os New Holland comprises a portion of land thus situated in the southern

hemisphere. Tropical India is to the northward and westward of it; and tropical India is in the N. E. trade
