Noun—For the purpose of arriving at greater aecuracy a boat was lowered, and the line was under-run until it was up and down
at 1,510 satha. when it was cut. Ι am of opinion that the shot was on the bottom.'’

U. S. S. “ GERMANTOWN,'’
Anchorage off flionrovia, July ⁴2, 1851.

‘⁶ Sin: l have the honor to report that, on the l7th and 26th of April last, and on the 7th of June, we
made several attempts to sound the ocean3 in all, eleven. The greatest quantity of twine veered out at any
one time, did not exceed 200 sathomS. The loss attending these attempts was about 1,2ΟΟ fathoms of twine,
and eleven condemned 32 11). shot. These sailures are no doubt to be attributed somewhat to the inferior quality
of the twine 3 to its having been in store at the New York Navy Yard, some four or five months before we got
it, (it having been made for the “ Dale,’' but not finished in time sor her to get before she sailed,) and there·
sore perhaps not persectly sound.

It is about two-thirds smaller in size, and no doubt three-fourths less in weight, and many times less in
strength, than that os the “John AdamS.’' BesideS, the reel provided this vessel is a very common one, such
as are used for reeling sigging upon in store3 whereas that of the John Adams is fitted with patent friction
rollerS, &a

Ι am sorry to say, that I am of opinion that we shall not be able to get soun'dings in any depth over 200

fathoms—still I shall not fail to sound again when in deep water, and the weather will admit of it.'’

To, these accountS, Ι have appended Lieut. Walsh’s deep-sea sounding in the ‘STaney'’ with wire3 and the

 

“ Saratoga’s’' deep-sea sounding in the South Atlantia. The S. had 100,000 fathoms os sounding line on board
of triple the size of that with which the ‘⁶ Albany ’' was surnished. She, much to my regret‚ went all the
way from the United States to Rio, without getting a single cast; nor has any thing been heard from her in
the way os deep-sea soundings‚ since she reported the one quoted in the table—though she has traversed the
Indian Ocean and been cruising in the China seas. “ The St. Mary's ” was supplied with twine like that of

the “Albany ” ; she went around Cape Horu, and reported from Rio on her way, that she could do nothing in

the way os deep sea sounding with such twine.
