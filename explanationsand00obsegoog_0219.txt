“ Dua Sm 2—Knowing the interest you feel in deep sea soundings ordered by the Bureau of Ordnance
and Hydrography‚ I send you a rough abstract os those taken up to the present time on borad of this vessel.
1 presume you will receive an official report from the proper source on the subject when the vessel shall have
reached her station. The Master has sounded every day when the weather permitted‚ using sometimes one,
sometimes tw0, round shot. The nippers for sounding proving of no use have been dispensed with, and the
supposition of having on several occasions reached bottom, arose from the fact that the line paying out briskly

would suddenly cease, and on being hauled in would for a moment come up very heavily, and then, as though

the weight of the shot had parted from it, come up easily.”

“ Sm z—In compliance with your circular of the lst June, 1850, Ι have to report the result of my deep sea

soundings during my passage to this place. The weather being very unfavorable, I did not sound until the
3d os September, in Lat. 370 28’ N„ and Long‚ 560 32¹ W.‚ when Ι hove to and let the line run out one hour
and fifty-five minuteS‚ at which time it had taken 5,500 fathoms off the reel.

The ship’s drist during this time, as near as we could ascertain by the log, 1 supposed to be about two
miles· At this time the wind and sea had both increased so much, Ι deemed it advisa'ole to part the line and
await a more favorable opportunity, not being able to sound with any accuracy. On the 9th‚ the weather
being more favorable‚ Ι again got a cast, Lat. 340 11¹ N„ Long. 430 21’ W.‚ the line continued running off

rather more than an hour; at this time ibae was 2‚800 sathoms run off, when the line became 818011, hauled
