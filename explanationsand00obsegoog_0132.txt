We sometimes come across arms of the sea, or places in the ocean, where we find the water more ε
or less salt than sea water is generally; but this circumstance is due to local causes os easy explanation. 3
instance ε When we come to an arm of the sea, as the Red Sea, upon which it never raim, and from wl
the atmosphere is continually abstracting‚ by evaporation, fresh water from the salt, we may naturally ex}
to find a greater proportion of salt in the sea water that remains, than we do near the mouth of some g]
river, as the Amazon3 or in the regions of constant precipitation, or other parts, where it rains more tha
evaporates: and though therefore we do not find sea water from all parts of the ocean actually of the s:
degree of saltness, yet we do find, as in the case of the Red Sea, sea water that is continually giving ol
evaporation fresh water in large quantities; nevertheless‚ for such water, there is a degree 3ηά 3 very mode1
degree of saltness which is a maximum3 and we moreover find, that though the constituents of sea water, ἶ
those of the atmosphere‚ are not for every place invariably the same as to their proportions, yet they are
same or nearly the same as to their character.

When therefore we'take into consideration the fact, that as a general rule, sea water is, with the ex<
tion above stated, every where 3ηά always the same, we find, grounds on which to base the conjecture,
the ocean has its system of circulation which is probably as complete and not less wonderful than is the
culation of blood through our system.

In order to investigate the⁴currents of the sea, and to catch a glimpse of the laws by which the circula
of its ·waters is governed, hypothesis, in the present meagre state of absolute knowledge with regard to
subject, seems to be as necessary to progresS, as is a corner stone to a building. To make progress ³
such investigations, we want something to build upon. In the absence of facts we are sometimes permi
to suppose them3 only, in making the selection of the various hypotheses which are suggested, we are bc
to preser that one to which the greatest number of phenomena will be reconciled. When we have found, tr
and offered such an one, we are entitled to claim for it a respectful consideration at least, until we discov
leading us into some palpable absurdity3 or until some other hypothesis be suggested which will account eq1
well, but for a greater number os phenomena. Then, as honest searchers after truth, we should be read
give up the former, adopt the latter, and to try it until some other better than either of the two be offered.

With this understanding, I venture to offer a hypothesis with regard to the agency of the salts or solid m
of the sea in imparting dynamical force to the waters of the ocean in their system of circulation, and to sug
that oneof the purposes which in the Grand Design it was probably intended to accomplish by having the sea
and not fresh, was to impart to its waters the forces and the powers necessary to make their circulation comp

In the first place, we do but conjecture when we say, that there is a set of currents in the sea and a syste
circulation in the sea, by which its waters are conveyed from place to place, with regularity, certainty and ο]
But this conjecture appears to be founded on reason, for if we takea sample of water wich shall fairly repre
in the proportion of its constituents the average water os the Pacific ocean, and analyse it 3—and if we d·
same by a similar sample from the Atlantic, we shall find the analysis of the one to resemble that of the c

aa closely as though the two samples had been taken from the same bottle after having been well shaken. ]
