such district. With these, Ι then proceeded to determine, by mathematical discussion, the mean or average
sonte, which, taking both calm8‚ head winds, and increase of distance into account, should give on the average
the shortest passage, in time, to the equatur.

Of course, then, when a vessel comes to try the new, ronta thus compared, and· to project on the eharttbq
track she actually makes through the water from day to day, it is not to be expected, that: the track so per-
sprmed, will when laid down, exactly overlay the one already projected on the chart 33 her guide- - 'l'here will
be a general conformity between the tw0, but nothing like the actual coincidiug of two. lines.

These remarks are called ἴοι-11111] the fact. that some navigatore appear to think that there is some sort
of virtue in the black mark on the chart, which represents any one of these routes--As the April route for in·
qtance: if driven from the April route by head winds, one of these navigators, had he been. in the “ Memnon-'⁹'
at, a, (Plate XL) would have stood north to get her keel on the black tnark for·April; and again at b, he would*
have stood tothe southwardrand westwardto get upon the April tmclt again. Ι ' , ” -

Now, the “ Μι·ιιιιιοιι” at a, or at b, was ιιι just 33 good a position as she would have been had she been

“right upon the tracltss’ Her very elever master, therefore, did right; he conformed to the 33111113 directions,

The tracks of. the vessels projected on Platea xJ and XII, have not been selected on account of their

short passages; many other vessels have made passages shorter than these. 1 hue tabu them only for th·-
