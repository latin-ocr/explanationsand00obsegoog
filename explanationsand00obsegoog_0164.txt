158 “ ‘ruz wrrtn Aur> cannam· casus.

On the 3d we got underway, and ran outto look at the ice3 but finding it still closely packed, returned
to our anchorage.

On the 6th, the accounts from our look-out on a hill near us were more favorable. Again we got under· κ
way, and finding the “ pack’' somewhatloose, succeeded in making some headway through it. The following
day we got into clear water, and sell in with two English whaling vesseIS‚ the Pacitic and the J ane. To their
gentlemanly and considerate commanders‚ we are much indebted sor the supplies furnished us, consisting of

potatoes‚ turniPS, and other articles most acceptable to people in our condition. Much interesting news was

also gained from them respecting important events which had occurred since we‘had left home. ‚

Their statement as to the condition of the ice to the northward, was anything but flattering to our pros-
pects. They had considered it so very unfavorable, as to abandon the attempt to push through Melville hay,
and were now on their way to the southward.

On the 8th we communicated with the settlement of Uppernavik. The next day two more English ves-
sels were passed on their way to the southward. At the same time, the McLellan, of New London, the only
American whaler in Baffin’s hay, was descried‚ also standing south. On communicating with her, we were
rejoiced to find letters and papers from home, transmitted by the kindness of Mr. Grinnell.

We remained by the McLellan several houm, in order to close our letters and despatch them by her.
Several articles that we stood much in need of were purchased from her. ο

On the loth, the Baffin islands being in sight to the north, we met the remainder of the whaling fleet re-
turning. They confirmed the accounts given us by the Pacific and the J ane, in regard to the unfavorable con·
dition of the ice sor an early passage through Melville bay. The following are the names of the vessels com·

muntcated with, viz: J oseph Green‚ of Peterhead3 Alexander, os Dundee 3 Advice, of do. ; Princess Charlotte,

of do‚; Horn, os do.; Anne, of Hull; Regalia‚ of Kirkaldy3 Chieftain, of do. ; and Lord Gambier‚ of .

My notes are unfortunatety at fault as to the names of their enterprising and warm-hearted commandere, each

 

of whom vied with the other in showering upon us such articles as they knew we must be in want of, consist-
ing of potatoes, turnipS, fresh bees, διο. My proposition to compensate them they would not entertain for a
moment, and I take this occasion of making public acknowledgment of the valuable aid rendered uS, to which,
’ no doubt, much of our subsequent good health is owing.

On the llth, in attempting to run between the Baffin islands‚ the Advance grounded on a rocky shoal.
The Rescue barely escaped the same fate by hauling by the wind, on discovering our mishap. Fortunately
there was a large grounded berg near, to which our hawsers could be taken for hauling off, which we succeeded
in doing aster twenty—four hours' hard work. The vessel had not apparently received any injury; hut a few
days later, another piece os her false keel came off, supposed to have been loosened on this occasion.

The ice to the north of these islands was too closely packed to be penetrated, and the prevalence of
southerly winds afforded but little prospect of a speedy opening.

On the 16th the searching yacht Prince Albert succeeded in reaching near to our position, aster having

been in sight for several dayS. Mr. Kennedy, her commender, came on board and brought us letterS.
