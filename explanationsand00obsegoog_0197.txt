the last named place. On the 3d instant, we sailed for Havana, with orders to be there the next day, and so

had no time to sound in running acrOSS. On the 6th, we sailed again in company with the Decatur, and that
evening we were off Matanzas‚ where we lay until the loth, when we started again, and hove to off Havana
at sunset. On the llth, we filled away for Pensacola, and to·day has furnrshed us the only opportunity for
sounding that we had since we left Key West.

‘⁴ This evening we got bottom with 1,327 fathoms line3 time of running, 27 minutes 31 seconds3 Lat.
270 ΟΟ’ N. ; Long. 850 43’ W. ; temp. air 850 ; temp. water 840. Drist at the rate of half a mile an-hour.

‘⁴ June 14tlz, 1851.-At 9 Α. Μ., got bottom with 376 fathoms3 time of running, doubtful. I think that
a mistake was made in noting it. Lat. 270 55’ Ν. ; Long. 850 44’ W.; temp. air 850; temp. water 840.
Drift nothing.

‘⁴ At 6 P. M., got another cast to verify the forenoon soundingS, and got bottom with 220 sathoms; time
of running, 2 minutes 8 seconds 3 Lat. 280 27’ N. ; Long. 850 54’ W. 3 temp. air 850 ; temp. water 840 Drift
nothing.

April luth, 1851.-Ῑ improve the opportunity of a steamer to send you my fourth report of our sounding
operations ; you will perceive that we have got a line across the Gulf of MexicO, and that in no portion of the
Gulf have we found quite 1,000 fathoms. As we enter the Gulf of Florida, the depth diminishes to 600 fathoms.
You will recolleet that we found only about 500 fathoms between Havana and the Great Bahama Bank. I am
just preparing a small reel of sewing silk, which I intend to have waxed‚ and marked (by knots) to one thou·
sand fathomS. I wish to try the experiment of sounding with it; having a small weight attached, to be deter-
mined by experience. We are now upon our last reel of twine, and I do not think we have more than 7,ΟΟΟ
fathoms remaining; so unless you have a new supply for us at Pensacola, we must stop the work. You will

never find another captain, 1 really believe, who will go into the thing so heartily as Captain Platt does.''

 

From these results we are entitled to infer, that this method of sounding, if not corrected for the effect of
under currents upon the line, will make the ocean appear rather deeper tlian it really ia. A cast is made3 the
shot reaches the bottom ; and the twine during the descent is swept off in a bigbt by an under current, the ἢ
precise quantity of line taken out by it, cannot be determined, and by the length of the line so taken out, we
are lest in fault as to the true depth. 1 regard this method, therefore, as an approximation. But as a general
rule, the approximation falls within comparatively narrow limits, and usually on the same side, viz: in excess;
so as to make the ocean appear deeper, rarely shallower than it really is. These deep sea soundingS, therefore,
may be regarded as a step in the work of measuring the depth of the ocean, by assuring us that its depth is
not beyond a certain extent. ‹

But to return to Lieut. Taylor's interesting reportS, in which the reader will find the points 1 have raised,
fully discussed.

At Sea, Dec. lst, mor—After nearly two months of inactivity at Pensacola, we are once more underway
and started upon a cruise, which will, 1 hope, be productive of interesting results in the way of sounding.
