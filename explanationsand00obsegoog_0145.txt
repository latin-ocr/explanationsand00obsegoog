not determine the amount of these errorS, he merely ascertained that there were errors in the best and latest

Russian charts.

It cannot be expected that vessels like Mr. J ones',whose more immediate object is the pursuit os fish, will,
as daring and adventurous as our whalemen are known to be, attempt to penetrate into the frczen ocean sar·
ther than the open sea will admit, or their game may entice them.

The limits of the region of packed ice are variable. In 1827, the southern edge of the packed ice was

found to commence about latitude ’70Ο Ν., longitude 1690 W., and to extend thence ina N. Ε. by Ε. course
at least as far as longitude 1600 W.

Sir John Franklin and his companionS, to whom Mr. Jones wishes to carry relief, are in the unknown parts
of the sea, and therefore, the information to be furnished, with regard to a well conducted search for him,

must consist necessarily and chiefly of deductions 3ηά generalizations derived from the best received theoriae

and opinions with regard to the climatology of those regions.

In the first place, it seems to be an admitted fact that there is acurrent setting North through Bhering’s
straits into the Frozen Ocean. Captain Roys sound it setting atthe rate of from 70 to 100 miles a day. This
is probably a constant current, though it may be supposed it runs fastest in summer: the water which it bears

along is of course supplied from the China seas3 coming from the equatorial regions it is therefore warmer

water than that of the Arctic Ocean into-which it flova.

The physical forces that operate upon this current to give it motion, require that it should pursue, after
entering the straitS, a northeasterly course ; so Capt. Roys found it. The edge of the packed iee the‘re (already
alluded to) seems also to confirm the opinion, that such is the course of this current. If so, the water ther·

mometer will tell, and Mr. J ones’ ships will be assured of the fact by the existence of a Polynia stretching up

in that direction.
How sar such an iceless sea will be found to extend to the eastward‚ should its existence be established,
observations can alone determine. But as a guide Ι beg to send the accompanying chart, on which Passed

Midshipman Gibbon has at my request projected the isothermal curves of 50 3ηά 100, from J ohnson’s Physical
Atlas.

These curves are, according to Sir David Brewster, probably lemniscates ; and as it is conjectured
that there are two poles of maximum cold, viz ι one in latitude 80Ο N. and longitude 1000 W„ and the other in lat-
itude 80Ο N. and longitude 950E. the mean temperature of the former-which is the American pole, is, according to
Sir David Brewster 3} degrees below zero ofFahrenheit, while that of the other or Siberian pole, is 1⁰above zero of

the same scale.

The line os packed ice is probably a curve, depending forits form partly upon isothermal lineS, and partly
upon the eddies caused by the meeting of the various currents in the Arctic ocean.
Supposing two such poles to exist in nature, the isothermal lines about them would be re·entering curves,

the exact sorm of which however cannot be determined without the aid of further observationS.

But according to this theory, the mean temperature of the North pole itself will differ not much from the
mean temperature os Lat. ’70ο N.
