“ Sur :—1 deem it proper to explain, that since our new sounding reel was fitted with 15,000 fathoms of
waxed and caresully marked line, no opportunity os measuring the depth of the ocean has occurred until this
noon3 when the sea being tolerably smooth, I got out one thousand six hundred and fifty fathomS. The first

1000 fathoms, fairly up and down. The drift then became too great sor accurate sounding, and when check-
ing the line it parted at about 150 fathoms from the reel. No bottom was reached, and the result cannot be

considered satisfactory. The depth, however, is certainly more than 1000 fathoms3 which, judging by the
formation os the coast, and by the effect produced upon the bed of the ocean by the mighty La Plata, is

greater than was anticipated.

Line lost, 1500 fathoms. Time of running out, 36 minuteS. Ohe 32 lb. shot used.''

“ Sin ε In obedience to your orderS, I repeated to-day the experiment attempted on the lst inst., to obtain a
correct sounding from the ship.

The weather was calm, and the ship, 9.30 A. M. was hove to; but alarge long swell gave a considerable
sursace drist to the northward and eastward. After running off the reel 2‚700 fathomS, without reaching
bottom, and the drist having become at least a mile, the line was checked and parted about 800 fathoms from
the reel. The first 1,000 fathoms went out in 18 minutes; the second l,000 fathoms in 24 minutes; and the

remaining 700 fathoms also in 24 minuteS. Whole running time, one hour and six minutes. One 32 lb. shot

as weight—1,900 fathoms line lost.
1 cannot state with any precision the vertical depth reached, andi arn constrained to declare that, from my
own limited experience, any accurate measurement of great depths is impossible, from the decks of a ship.

It may not be unworthy of remark that the vast sriction of a long line was curiously illustrated in the saving ⁰

of our 800 fathoms· Two stout men sound it hard work to ronse it inboard in half an hour’s time.'’

“ Sin: 1 haxe the honor to report the results os our experiments yesterday in deep soundings,

After becoming convinced that no reliance could be placed upon deep soundings taken from ship board,

you directed that the next should be taken from a boat3 and yesterday, at nine A. M., April 4th, 1 lest the ship

to carry out your instructions.
