1111 THE wmn Arm cuasam· ctutum.

“ 'I'he “Sovereign of the Seas” had in her favor that long, rolling swell from the westward, that is peculiar
to high southern latitudeS, and which helped mightily to heave her along. Au searnen who have doubled Cape
Horn know what it is; 1 need not describe it.

‘⁶ It is true the “Flying Cloud'' on her great day, had, “during the latter part, strong gales and high seas run-
ning;'’ still those “high seas’' were not like that long rolling Cape Horn swell that comes from the westward with
such a heaving force, and which had been chasing the “Sovereign of the Seas'' steadily for ten days.

“ On the other hand, it may be urged in favor of the latter, that she was short handed, and deeplyladen,
with soretopmast disabled, and jury topgallant mast. Her abstract log, it should also be mentioned, says noth-
ing as to the force of the wind, the heave of the sea, or the sails set, while that of the “Flying Cloud'' is quite
sull upon these points·

“ Through I am unwilling, therefore, to decide against the ⁴·Flying Cloud’' as to the greatest day’s run ever

made, it is clear that her competitor has borne off the palm as to the length of time for which she has kept up

her great speed. Her log stops May 3d, latitude 35 deg. 16 min. N., 432 nautical miles in a straight line from
Sandy Hook.

“ Taking it therefore for the seventy-nine days for which she gives it, and stating the distance by straight
line stom her place at noon of one day to the noon of the next, it appears that her daily average was 227 sta·
tute mileS, making the whole distance sailed during the interval to be 17‚597 statute mileS, which gives for can·
vass the remarkable achievement os accomplishing a distance more than two-thirds of that which it requires to
encircle the earth, at the average rate of nine miles and upwards the hour for 1‚896 consecutive hoan.

“ As 1 write this, the abstract of another ship, the “Comet,” E.C. Gardner, from San Francisco to New York,
is received. She, too, has made an extraordinary run. She made the passage in 833 dayS, sailing during the
interval 17.496 statue mileS, and averaging 210 miles a day. She, however, except merely by doubling Cape
Horn, did not run through the region of the trade like winds and heaving swells of the South Pacific, which sa·
vored the “Sovereign of tbe Seas'' to such an extent3 and therefore no fair comparison can be made as to the rel-
ative sailing qualities of these two ships.'' ⁴ ⁴ ⁴

“ But the “Flying Dutchman,” Capt Hubbard, held her a beautiful race. This is a clipper, and sailing one
day only before the “Comet,'’ had a run os 84 days from San Francisco to the offings of New York.

“11¹ae days from port, she doubled the Cape. She did not get regularly into·the famous N. W. trades of
the southern hemisphere until she reached the parallel of 500 8.; She then flew with them around the Cape,

and carried them to 340 in the South AtlantIc as per the following extract from her log:
‘⁴ March l9th, 1853. Lat. at noon 510 10’ S; Long. at do. 850 09¹-W.; bar. 30.2; ther.‚ air 510, wa·
