then quite astonishing to see with what exactness they pursue their course. Not unfrequently they are pur·
sued by a ship the space of a whole day together without altering their course a single point of the compass.
What can enable these inhabitants of the deep to thus pursue an undeviating course for a day, and most likely
sor as long a period as they choose?

So far as our knowledge extends the inequalities of the earth’s sursace beneath the sea, are similar to
those above, aud the conjecture, therefore, is a reasonable one, which supposes that the utmost cavities of the
sea, do not exceed the loftiest heights above it. May not then these occupants of the watery world, like those
of earth and air, be guided on their way by visible objects? For without such guidunce, no animal, man not
excepted, can long pursue an unvarying course. Instinct may urge the animal when to move, but something
discernable must aid its way through the deep with such precision. Nor is it at all unreasonable to suppose
that, by a wise provision of nature, their organs of vision are as well adapted sor the watery clement, as ours
are for the aerial one.

These large whales generally spout from fifty to sixty times when to the surface, and the spouts appear
at intervals of about fifteen secondS, thoughrwhen the whale first appears they are rather more hurried than
afterwardS, this occupies nearlya quarter of an honr, aster which they go down, and stop beneath the sea an
hour, or an hour and a half, but never exceed this before they return to the surface again sor the purpose of
respiration. Thus between one-fourth aud one-fifth of their time is occupied in sustaining vitality, by breath·
ing atmospheric air. The periods of time passing while the whale is in· the depths below are often nicely
measured. I‘n one instance the writer was in pursuit of a whale which was going quite fast nearly a day, and
all this time he never stopped beneath the surface more than fifty ·two minuteS, nor less than fisty3 he spouted
no more than 48 times at a rising, nor less than 46. His other movements were equally uniform.

It is observed that whales suspend their breath longer in some seas than in otherS, probably because they
go deeper for their food. Some idea may be given of the depth to which they go, by stating that when har-
pooned it is sometimes necessary to connect three or more lines together to prevent them from escaping. Each
of these lines is commonly 225 fathoms long, so that ir a whale take from boats four of these lines there is attached
to it a continued line nearly a statute mile. It would not, however, go the whole depth3 but, unless the des-
cent was perpendicular‚ the whale’s course would describe a sort of curve, and from the great length of line
out, and pressure of the sea on it, the whale would continue to take line'srom the boats until it reached the
sursace, or nearly so; when in this condition the whale appears, it is generally found in an exhausted state,
arising principally, it may be supposed, from its fright and struggles to get free, though some conceive it to
be produced by the weight of the vast volume of water that musthave pressed upon it while in the sea beneath.
But this latter hypothesis seems rather untenable, sor though the pressure may be great, yet is small fry, such
as are caught from an hundred fathoms or 80, can bear this pressure, then one bulky whale is not likely to get
squeezed beyond endurance in the deepest cavern of the sea.

Spermaceti Whales are rarely, ir ever, seen on soundingS, though they are often seen and taken near land;

but in this case there is always a bold shore and great depth of sea.
