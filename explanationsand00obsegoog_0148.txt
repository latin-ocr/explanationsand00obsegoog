The steamers of course should be properly constructed, 3ηά provided with ice breakers or saws by·
they could in case of emergency cut their way out through the ice as well as a way for their provision sh

The steamers sor such service need not be large. Mr. J ones does not propose sending an expedition ι
sively in search of Sir John Franklin, therefore those remarks do not apply to his case. But Mr Jonas
his associateS‚ are evidently gentlemen os humane disposition and n9ble impulseS‚ therefore 1 have vei
to make these suggestione, feeling assured that they would bc received as they are meant and only sor
they are worth.

The “ Huntsville '’ and the “ Alice '’¹'' of course will not fail to be provided with faithful interpreter
through them they will be sure to make diligent enquiries among the natives for intelligence of Sir John, a
expedition. The Indians should be induced by presents or the promise os rewards to examine the eoas
and to enquire from tribe to tribe as to when and where he was last, if ever seen.

Doubtless these two private ships 3ηά their crews, will in the proposed voyage render a gratifyir
acceptable service to the people of christendom.

Should it be desired, another chart, the duplicate of the one herewith sent, can be prepared at this
so that each vessel may have one of the same kind. There are also other charts here, relating to th
straits and Arctic America, which isso authorised, 1 shall be glad to put at the disposal of the masters
“Huntsville'' and “Alice.''

P. S.—In the haste in which this letterhas been necessarily prepared in consequence os being at

among thc most important os these is a suggestion concerning a depot of coals and provisions near Well
Straits or some other suitable place this side, to which the steamers might look for supplies, in the e‘
