North with that which comes from the South-ss-of the moist and the dry air as it descends here to the s
of the Earth--if it depended upon chance whether the dry air should come out on this side, or on th
their calm belt3—-or whether the moist air should return whence it came or not; if such were the cz

nature, we perceive, that so sar from any regularity as to seasons, we should have, or might have, ye:
droughts the most excessive, and then again seasons of rains the most destructive3 but so far from thi
find for each place a mean annual proportion of both, and that too so regulated withal, that year after yea
quantity is preserved with remarkable regularity.

Therefore, seeing reasons why ε’ and δ” should cross each other in the calms of Cancer, and seein
reasons why they should not, 1 was led to the inference that here probably is a node in the circulation c
atmosphere, where the wind from the North meets the wind from the South 3 and that each, after a pause,
tinues on its course and returns again to complete his circuit. The fact, it appeared to me, was probable
the cause a myster-53 for did this crossing of currents not take place, here would be a barrier in the at
phere3 and we, the inhabitants of the extra-tropical regions of the North, would have always to breath

atmosphere, which circulates not over all parts of the Earth and in both hemispheres, but only in the N
between the calms of Cancer and the Pole.

Having thus shown that there is no reason for supposing that the upper cut-rents of air when they ι
ovet the calma of Cancer and Capricorn, are turned back to the equator; but having shown that the:

reason for supposing that the air of each currentafter descending, continues on in the direction towards w
it was traveling before it descended3 we may go further, and by a similar train of circumstantial evidence, afl
ed by the charts, and other sources of information, show that the air kept in motion on the surface by the
systems of trade winds, when it arrives at the belt of equatorial calms‚ and having ascended, continues
thence, esch current towards the pole which it was approaching while on the surface.

There is no reason for supposing that the atmosphere does not pass freely from one hemisphere to anot]
on the contrary, many reasons for supposing that it does, present themselves·

If it did not—the proportion os land and water, and consequently of plants and warm-blooded anim
being so different in the two hemispheres—we might imagine that the constituente of the atmosphere in th
would, in the course of ages, probably, become different3 and that consequently in such a case, man could
sasely pass from one hemisphere to the other.

1 considered the manifold beauties 1n the whole system of terrestrial adaptatione :—1 reflected wha
perfect and wonderful machine is this atmosphere z—-how exquisite-ly balanced and beautifully compensated
is in all its parts.--We all know that it is perfect 2—that in the performance of its manifold offices it is ne
once left to the guidance of chance-ssno, not for a moment z——therefore I was led to ask myself why the
of the N. E. trades, when arrived at the zone of aquatorial calms‚ should, after ascending, rather reu
to the North than to the South. Where and what is the principle upon which its course is decided?

Here again, 1 found circumstances which induced me to suppose it probable, that neither turned back

the North, nor mingled with the air which came from the regions of the Sa B.- trades, amended, and th
flowed indiscriminately to the North or the South.
