Passayes to Galifornia Reviewed.

The last mail from Calisornia brought me the abstract logs of the ‘⁴ Wild Pigeon,’' Captain Putnam3 os
the “John Gilpin,’' Captain Doane3 of the ‘⁴ Flying Fish,‘’ Captain Nickels; and of the ⁴⁴ Trade Wind,‘’
Captain Webber—all clipper ships, ably commanded, and navigated most admirably.

The tracks of these ships are capital illustrationS, of what ship masters may gain by recollecting that the
information which the Wind and (terrent Charts spread before them, is not of my teaching, or that of any one

person3 that it is worth more than the experience of any single navigator, sor it is the experience of thou·

Moreover‚ these abstract logs furnish accounts of a racc, ia which each ship being put upon her meula,
was driven at her topmost speed, the one almost in hail of the other, for three months over a course of 15‚000
miles in length. „,

All sailed from New York, in the autumn of 1852. The ⁴⁴ Wild Pigeon,’' October 12th3 the ‘⁴ John

one was provided with the Wind and Current Charts. Each one had evidently studied them attentively3 and
each one was resolved to make the most of them, and do his best. All ran against time3 but the “John
Gilpin'' and the ‘⁴ Flying Fish'' for the whole course, and the ⁴⁴ Wild Pigeon'’ for part of it, ran neck and
neck, the one against the other, and each against all. It was a sweep-stake with these ships, around Cape
Hom and through both hemispheres.

⁴‘ Wild Pigeon'', led the other two out of New York, the one by seventeen, the other by twenty days. But
luck and the chances of the winds seem to have been against her from the start. As soon as she had taken her
departure, she fell into a streak of baffiing winda, and then into a gale, which she fought against and contended
with sor a week, making but little progress the while 3 she then had a time of it in crossing the ⁴‘ Horse Latitudes.”

Aster having been nineteen days out, she had logged no less than thirteen of them as days of calma and
