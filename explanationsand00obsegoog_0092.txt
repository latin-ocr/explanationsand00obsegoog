tell why the vapor which the same winds carry along, should not, in like manner, be precipitated on the wa)·;

nor why we should have a thunder storm, a gale of wind, or the display of any other atmospherical phenome-

non to·morrow, and not to·day—all that we can say is, that the·conditions of to·day are not such as the phe-

, nomenon requires for its own development.

Therefore, though we cannot tell why the sea-dust should fall not always in the same place, we may
nevertheless suppose thatin passing the same parallels it‘ does not always meet with the conditions—elec-
trical and others—favorable to the descent—and that these conditions might occur now in this place, now in
that. But that the fall does occur always in the same atmospherical vein ‚or general direction, my investiga·
tions would suggest, and 'Ehrenberg's researches prove.

J ud ging by the fall of sea or rain-dust, we may suppose that the currents in the upper regions of the atmos-
phere are remarkable for their general reg-ularity, for their general direction and sharpness of limits, soto speak.

We may imagine that certain electrical conditions are necessary to a shower of “ sea-dust,” as well as
to a thunder storm, and that th‘e interval'between the time of the equinox⁹ial disturbances in the atmosphere and
the occurrence of these showerS, though it does not enable us to determine the true rate of motion in the general
system os atmospherical circulation, yet i't assures us that it is not less on the average than a certain rate.

1 do not offer these remarks as an explanation with which we ought to rest satisfied3 1 rather offer them
in the true philosophical spirit of the distinguished microscopist himself z—simply as affording, as far as they
are entitled to be called explanation, that explanation which is most in conformity with the facts before us, and
which is suggested by the results of a novel and beautiful system of philosophical research.

Thus, though we have tallied‘the ai'r, and put labels on the wind to “tell whence it cometh and whither

goeth,” yet there evidently is an agent concerned in the circulation of the atmosphere, whose functions are
manifest but whose presence has never yet been recognised.

Where the air, which the N. E. trade winds meet in the equatorial calmS, that of the S. East, and the two
rise up together, what is it, where is the power which guides that from the North over to the South, and that
from the South up to the North?

The following hypothesis on the relation “between magnetism and the circulation of the atmosphere,”

may perhaps throw some light upon the answer to this questioni

, On the probable Relation between Maynetism and the Girculation qt· the atmosphere!

The discoveries of Faraday in dia-magnetism are calculated to guide me and to illuminate the darkness

in which many a philosopher has, no doubt, osten found himself surrounded, as he has endeavored to follow

“ the wind in his circuits’' over the trackless wastes of the ocean.
