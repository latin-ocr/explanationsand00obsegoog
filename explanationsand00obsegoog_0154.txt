around, as to the persons who built it ; neither could its age be arrived at. At 2 p. m. of the 28th, he reach-
ed Cape Bowden without further discovery. Erecting a cairn containing the information which would be
nseful to a distressed party, he commenced his journey back.

Unti} the 3d of September we were detained at this point by the closing in of the ice from the southward,
occasioned by strong S. E. windS, accompanied with thick weather and snow. On this day the packed ice
moved offfrom the edge of the fixed ice, leaving a practicable lead to the west, into which we at once stood. At
midnight, when about two-thirds of the way across the charmel, the closing ice arrested our progreSS. - We

were in some danger from heavy masses coming against uS‚ but both vessels passed the night uninjured. In

’ the evening of the 4th we were able to make 3 few miles more westing, and the following day we reached

Barlow's inlet. The ice being impracticable to the southward, we secured the vessels at its entrance. The
Assistauce‚ and her steam tender, were seen off Cape Hotham, behind which they disappeared in the course
of the day. .

Barlow's inlet would afford a good shelter for vessels in case of necessity, but it would require some cut-
mg to get in or out. The ice of· last winter still remained in it unbroken. -

A fresh breeze from the north on the 8th, caused the ice in the channel to set to the southward. 1t still
remained, however, closely packed on Cape Hotham. On the 9th, in the morning, the wind shifted to the
westward3 an opening appeared, and we at once got under way. v
. Passing Cape Hotham, 3 lead was seen along the south side of Cornwallis island, into which, with a
head wind, we worked slowly, our progress being much impeded by bay ice; indeed, it brought us to a dead
stand more than once. The following day we reached Griffith’s island, passing the southern point of which,
the English searching vessels were descried made fast to the ice at a few miles distance. The western lead
closing at this point, we were compelled to make fast a180. .

The ice here was so very unfavorable for· making further progres3‚ and the season was so far advanced,
that it became necessary to take further movements into serious consideration. A consultation was held with
the commander of the Rescue, 3ηά after reviewing carefully all the circumstances attending our position, it
was judged that we had not gained a point from whi'ch we could commence operations in the season of 1851
with decided advantage& Therefore, agreeably to my instructionS, 1 felt it an imperative duty to extricata
the vessels from the ice aud return to the United States.

The state of the weather prevented our-acting immediately upon this decision.

September llth, wind from the eastward, with fog and snow, we were kept stationary 3 much bay ice

forming; thermometer 260. Early in the morning of the 12111 the wind changed to the N. W. and increased
rapidly to a heavy gale, which, carrying off the ice, brought with it clouds of drift snow.

The Rescue was blown from her ice anchors, and went adrift so suddenly that a boat and two of her
men were left behind3 she got under sail, but the wind was too strong for her to regain the ice. The driving
snow soon hid her from us. The Advance came near meeting the same fate ; the edge of the floe kept break-

ing away, and it was with much difficulty that other ice anchors could be planted further in, to hold on by.
The thermometer fell to 80 ; mean for the 24 hours, 140.
