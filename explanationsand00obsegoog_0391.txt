respectively. And it is remarkable how the tracks of these vessels, and all others that have followed these
sailing directionS, have conformed in their windings and irregularities to the tracks of the charts.

See the place at which all four of these vessels crossed the parallel of 50 N.‚ to the place where they
crossed the Line3 it is very nearly a direct South course, as represented by the tracks with the arrowS, gen-
erally for winter aad spring; and as before remarked, the lines which represent the tracks for these months do
not represent the tracks which it is possible for one sbip in 100 actually to make, but they represent the mean
or average track, which 100 ships sailed by navigators that never were wrong, would make.

Let us turn now to Plate XII, which is aa illustration of the summer and sall tontes,

This is the season of the year in which short passages are the most difficult by any route, old or new.

Track ,τ is the track of a ship that had the charts on board. The Captain of that ship, judging from the
track that he made, evidently undertoolr to set up bis “ own experience’' against the experience of the
thousand of navigators who had gone before him, all of which the charts held, spread out before him.

The track of the brig “Acasta” is given as an illustration of an attempt often made to “split the
difference” between the old and new route.

She sailed from Sag Harbor, September 20th, 18503 went as sar as 220 W., and crossed the Line in
Long. 260—November 14th—55 dayS. She got the “ doldrums'’ in about 110 N ., and they stuck by her for
15 dayS, and until she reached 20 N.

The fragment of the track w, illustrates the case of a vessel that attempted the new route, and abandoned
it when she fell in with the equatorial “ doldrums'’ in 110 N.—September 25th, 1850. She was going on very

well, but here she met the southerly monsoons which the charts warned her of at this season of the year. The

 

vessels have made long passages in consequence of not knowing the proper place to crosa the Equator, and how to take advantage of the
wind, when they lose the N. Ε. trades near the California consa·

1 cannot close without making the acknowledgment. that 1 consider myself indebted to your ‘⁸ wind and Current chart-⁸⁹⁹ for the
short passage 1 have had from N ew York to this port; aa 1 passed through all thetropical latitudea without any calma, aad wasia latitude
of the river Plate‚ in 35 days from New York ς which run 1 consider rarely, is ever, equalled.”

⁸ 1 have at the moment of going to presa received another of the admirably kept abstracta of Captain Myrick. It is the log of the
clipper ahip ⁴⁴ Seaman's Bride '⁹ from N ew York to California, where he arrived 1911: May, 1852. He croased the Equetor in the Pacific
in long. 1040 W. He was9 days thence, through the equatorial doldrums‚ to the parallel of 110 N ., long. 1100 W. He says ε “ Iam de·
termined never again to crosa the Equator to the eaatward of 1100, as we have been fighting calma, squallr and baffling winda from lat. 30
N. to 110 N .‚ when they might, 1 think, have been avoided by crossing to the West.’' He had 26 days from the Line to San Francisco.
He lost the N. E. trades in :³30 Long. 1350, and was ⁴ days thence to port. Now had he crossed the Equatorto the West of 1100, he
probably would not, my researches show, have found the belt ofequatorial doldrums‚ for this month, any narrower or less difficult to croat-
He would probably have been forced by the N. E. trades off to the northward or westward several degrees further than he was when he
lost them, and the difficulties then of getting to the eastward in the Horae Latitudes and variables of the Pacific, would have been nearly
aa great as those of the ‘⁸ Equatorial Doldrums.'' So the chauces are that he would have gained not more than a day or two by crossing
to the West of 1100.

The “ Great Britain,'’ Captain Caldwell, a ship 25 years old and a dull sailer, crossed the Equator in the same place, just one week
after the ‘⁸ Scaman’s Bride.” The “ Great Britain ’⁹ carried the S. E. trades up to 70 N. Between that parallel and 80N. she was in the
“ doldrurns’' for two days. Then taking the N. Ε. trades in 1120 W., between 80 and 90 N.‚ she carried them to270 N. ln 1290 W. She
was 7 days fighting light aira and calms in the ‘⁸ Horae Latitudes‚”between the parallelo of 270 and 290. She crossed them without going
west of 1300 W., and frorn that meridian aad the parallel of 300 Ν , was six days in to port. She had in aJl 30 days from the Line to
San FranciscO, and 138 days at sea from N ew York. considering the aailing qualitiee of the “ Great Britain ’⁹ and the “ Scantan’s Bride.”
Caldwell’a passage of 30, days from the line, ia just about cqual to Myrick’ae of 26-Caldwell is very well satisfied with his croaaing.
