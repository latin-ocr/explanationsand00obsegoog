baffling winds; these had brought her no further on her way than the parallel of 260 N. Thence she had a
fine run to the Line, crossing it between 330 and 34ο W.‚ the thirty-second day out. She was unavoidably
forced to cross it so far west: for two days before, she crossed 50 N ., 111 300-311 excellent position.

In proof that the “ Pigeon’' had accomplished all that skill could do and the chauces against her would
permit, we have the testimony of the barque “Hazard,'’ Capt. Pollard. This vessel being bound to Rio at the
same time, followed close after the “ Pige-om„ The “ Hazard’' is an old hand with the charts; she had
already made six voyages to Rio, with them for her guide. This was the longest of the six, the mean of which
was twenty-six and a half days. She crossed the Line this time in 340 3Ο’, also by compulsion, having
crossed 50 N. in 310. But the fourth day after crossing the equator, she was clear of Cape St. Roque,
while the “ Pigeon’' cleared it in three days,

So far, therefore, chauces had turned up against the “ Piggonss’ in spite of the skill displayed by Putnam
as a navigator, sor the “ Gilpin” and the “ Fish” came booming along, not under better management, but
with a better run of luck and fairer courses before them. In this stretch they gained upon her t—the “Gilpin”
seven and the “ Fish” ten days3 so that now the Abstract Logs showed the “ Pigeon'’ to be ‘but ten days
abead. .

Evidently the “ Fish” was most confident that she had the heels of her competitors ; she felt her strength3
was most anxious for a quick run3 and eager with all, for a trial. She dashed down southwardly from Sandy
Hook, looking occasionally at the charts3 but, feeling proud in her sweep of wing, and trusting confidently in
the judgment of 1131 master, she kept on the average two hundred miles to leeward of the right traclr. Rejoicing
in her many noble and fine qualities, she spread 1131 wings to the utmost stretch, trusting quite as much in her
sails as in the charts, and performed the extraordinary seat of bounding, the sixteenth day out from New York,
across the parallel of 50 Ν.

The next day she was well south of 40, and in the “ Doldrums,” long. 340.

Now her heels became paralysed, for fortune seems to have deserted her awhile, at least her master as

the winds failed him feared so; they gave him his motive power3 they were fickle, and he was helplessly

baffled by them. The hugbear of a northwest current off Cape St. Roque looked alarming ; then the dread
of falling to leeward, and the chance of finding his fine ship back-strapped, filled the mind of Nickels with
evil forebodings and shook his saith in his guide.

The sailing directions had cautioned the navigator again and again not to attempt to fau along to the
Eastward in the equatorial “DoldrumS,'’ for by so doing he would find himself engaged in a fruitless strife, with
baffling airs, sometimes reinforced in their weakness by westerly currentS. But the winds had failed, and so
too he evidently thought had the Sailing Directions.

If there be a breeze, and if it be fair, sor making easting in the “Doldr11m8,'’ and if the navigator be too
far West, of course he should then make easting. But if the airs be light and haffling, the vessel will only

continue the longer in the “Doldrum8,'’ by steering East or West, for then she runs along with the calm belt.

But by steering North or South she goes straight across it, and in the least time possible.
