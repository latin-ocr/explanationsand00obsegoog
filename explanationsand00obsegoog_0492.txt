ΒΞΡ Nort.—Frequent mention has been made and much stress laid in this work as to the peninsula os cold water, in the North
Atlandtic, and aa to the probabilities of soundings sar to the southward and eastward, as well as to the northward and eastward of the
Gran Banks. .

The ahi ‘⁴ Hudson,'’ Capt. Simpmn, is said to have got soundings in 35 sathorns—mud—about Lat. 450 N .‚ Long. 430 W.

Capt. . D. Richter, of the ‘⁴ Antarctic,'' on a voyage last June srorn New Orleans to Liverpool‚ reporta a most remarkable change
both in temperature and color of the water—the former may possibly have been caused by an iceberg, still it is very desirabte to have
more temperatures and soundings near the same place. This phenornenon occurred between his position, Lat. 300 3& N ., Long. 630 6·
W., at noon, June 24th, and his position the next day at noon, viz: 390 4⁴¹ Ν., 610 2⁹ W.

1 quote s rom the very excellent and valuable abati-act that he has returned to thia office.

Sec account, June 24, 1851.

‘⁶ At 1 P. M.. observed the water to be much changed from a blue to a very light green, caught up the thermometer and hove it
over, and looking at it 1 was very much surprised to see that it had fallen 11 degrees since 9 A. M„ which was then 77, and 1 judged
within the influence os the Gulf. One bour aster, it had fallen to 540, and in 25 minutes after, to 523 the color of the water a very light
green, the ehi going about four knots to the eastward with a light breeze from the west. At 3 Ρ. Μ., a sog bank was approaching the
ship srorn theim N.W. and Ν., which soon enveloped the ship in a cold mist, and changing the wind to that quanter, and bringing with
it some considerable awell. Observed great quantities of cbips, took-need, and some sew sprigs os galf-weed. Lutled the ship up in the
wind and tried sor soundinga with the patent lead, but in the hurry did not get down but about eighty sathoms—no bottorn—-4 P. M„
water 560, at 8, 660, and at 12, 700, wind W. by S.

“ 1 notice on the chart there ia a bank or shoal laid “down in this neighborhood, called Anne Bank, and in the ‘ Memoir Atlantic
Ocean‚’ it ia called Reti] the position of which has not been very accurately determined. lt is mentioned as being in about
Lat. :390 N. and 640 20' W. Oui· latitude by observation, one bour before 1 tried the water, or at noon, was 390 38’ and longitude by a
good chronorneter 630 06'-[two‚·in fact, very good onem]

‘⁴ 1 think is there was any bottom there, we had probably got past it before 1 nounded. During the following twenty-four honre we
have had very little, is any, guis current.''
