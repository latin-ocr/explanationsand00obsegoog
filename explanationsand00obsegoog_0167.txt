The U. S. Schooner “ Taney‚” Lieut. J. C. Walsh commanding, was the vessel, and her uniitness for
such service is the more to be regretted, as her officers one and all, entered upon this field· of research with so
much spirit.

The “ Taney,” well equipped sor the duties assigned her, sailed from New York in October, 1849, with
the following instructions issued from the N avy Department:

“ The object of the service upon which the ‘ Taney’ has been detailed, is to make observations upon the
winds and currents of the sea, and to collect other facts in connection with the ‘ Wind and Curre‘nt Charts ’ of
Lieut. Maury,-and which are of practical importance to the safe navigation of the seas, or to the study of the
phenomena of the ocean. This is an important service. It is a service which requires patient and laborious

observatione from the officers entrusted with it.

“ A faithful record of every phenomenon observed, with a full statement of all the circumstances as to time,
place, δια, connected with it, is of great importance.

“ It is expected, therefore, that you and the officers of the ‘ Taney,’ will bestow upon the duty which has
been assigned yoursels 3ηά them, because of a peculiar fitness therefor, the utmost diligence and the most
assiduous attention.

“ The subjects of observation which will command your particular attention, are ε

“ lst, The force and direction os the wind, the hourly state of the weather, and all the meteorological con·
ditions connected therewith, as thmmal, dynamical‚ barometrical‚ and the like.

“ 2d, The force and set of currents‚ their depth and width‚ their temperatur-e and the position os their edges
or limits. ·

“ 3d, Hourly observations upon the temperature of the sursace water.

“4th, Frequent observations upon the temperature of the ocean at various depths.
“ 5th, Deep·sea soundingS.

“ 6th, Vigias, and all dangers about which there are douth, either as to existence or position.

“ 7th, Transparency and saltness, or the specific gravity of sea water, in the different parts of the ocean.

“ Yon will determine the specific gravity of the water, either by one‘of the hydrometers, or the specific

gravity bottle furnished for the purpose.

“ Yon will keep an abstract of your log as per form. It is believed that the form itself is sufficiently explicit
33 to what is wanted for the abstract, a copy of which you will send to Lieut. Maury, as often as you have an
opportunity, returning the original to him when you arrive in the United States.

“ Yon will make it a rule, the better to ascertain rate of currents and fixtheir limits, to determine by obser-
vation the variation os the compass and your position in the sorenoon‚ in the asternoon and at night, as well as
at noon, whenever the weather will permit ; and after allowing sor lec-way, heave of the sea, variation of the
compass, and the false steerage, you will call the difference between the place of the vessel as established by ob-

servation, and as established by dead reckoning, current, and so to enter it in the abstract.

‘² You will also try in calms, and as often as convenient, both sor surface and under currents, in the usual

way, by loweriglg boats, letting down weights, διο.
