The average rate of descent for the first 2,ΟΟΟ sathoms of this sounding was 50.4 sathoms a minute,
whereas the rate of descent for the sounding (2,300) sathoms of May loth, was only 32 fathoms per minute.

Hence, I infer that the shot-May loth—had reached the bottom sooner than was expected, for this cast
was only 67 miles from that of 5,500 sathoms the day before, and the officers, donbtleSS, did not expect the
shot to reach the bottom so soon. The ‹lrist of the ship, probably, continued to take the line out after the shot
had reached the bottom, for that it was on the bottom, the great strain felt upon the line leaves no doubt.

My inference is, therefore, that the sea here is not 2,300 fathoms deep, while it is nearly twice that depth
60 miles further to the North.

Here is a new feature brought out as to the depths of the ocean, and one which we were not prepared to
anticipate3 at least Ι had always supposed that the bottom of the sea generally, was somewhat regular in
outline, passing gradually from deep to shallow, and from shallow to deep; that the exceptions are such as we
find near the land, being confined mostly to its immediate vicinity, and that the precipices to be found in the
depths of the ocean seldom exceed a few hundred feet in descent.

But judging from these two sounding of May 81h and loth, we perceive that we should not now be sur·
prised if this system of observations should shew that the shape of the Earth's crust at the bottom of the sea
is quite as irregular in its outlineS, in its elevations and depressionS, in its mountains and its valleys, as is the
face of our continents. ,

In this case of the “ John Adam8‚” the line, owing to an ‘under current perhaps, and the drist of the

ship, continued probably to run out after the shot had reached the bottom. Indeed' there is room for the
conjecture that the shot reached the bottom, when a little more than 4,000 fathoms of line had been payed out.

If we examine the rates above as they are given for each 1,ooo fathoms, we find that they have something
like a regular ratio of decrease. The 3d 1‚000 fathoms took 27 minutes 58 seconds in going out. The 4th
1‚000 took 29 minutes 12 seconds. But the 5th 1,000 took 45 mirantes, and the last 500 fathoms, or from
5‚000 to 5,500, took 22 minutes 30 εεοοηάε, or exactly half of what it took the 5th thousand fathoms. The
shot was, therefore, probably on the bottom, soon after the 4,000 fathoms had gone out, which would make
the ocean here probably about 23 or 25‚ooo feet deep.

If at this sounding, every 100 or 200 fathoms had been timed as at the deep casts of the Albany

in February last, (p. 207,) we should perhaps have been furnished with the means of a more satisfactory conclu·
sion with reg-ard to this interesting sounding. ⁹
