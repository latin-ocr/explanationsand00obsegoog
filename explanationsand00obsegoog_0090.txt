If their be reason in this question, and plausibility in the answer it suggestS, an affirmative reply w
authorize us to infer that the “ fatherland” of the ‘⁴ rain dust” is one place for the spring and another sor
autumn 3 and therefore it mightbe expected that the microscope would detect certain infusoria that are pec1
each to its own dust and locality.

These are the periods and these the conditions most favorable for raising the “ sea-dust,” and may
not therefore refer to these conditione, and suggest that in them is to be found reason for the greater liab
of the “ rain dust'' to fall in April and May, October and November, than at other times·

If one season of the year be most favorable to· the taking up of the infusoria, another season may be n
favorable for letting them down again. The charts indicate the former3 the microscope shows the latter t<
the case.

And may we not therefore regard the interval between the time most favorable for the ascent, and the ti
in which the descent is most likely to occur, as a sort of general indication as to the length of the time requi1
for the transportation ; and therefore as to the rate of motion of the atmosphere in its general channels of c
culation ? ,

These suggestions as to the taking up the (lust in the valley of omnmo, derive weight from the observ
tions of the closest of observers·
