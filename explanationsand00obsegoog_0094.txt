Where then does the vapor, which is here on the northern edge os this zone of Cancer, condensed into
rains—and where also does the vapor which the rain winds that flow out on the polar side of this zone—

where ?—was the oft-repeated question—does the vapor which is condensed into rains sor the extra-tropical

regions of the North, come from?

Could it be taken up by the N. Ε. trade winds; and could it be the residuum, which, 'after supplying the
equatorial calms with their rain, was carried up in the ascending column of air there, and which residuum
was brought back in the upper regions of the atmosphere by the current which we know perpetually blows up
there, counter to the trade winds: could this be so?

We know that there is an upper current of perpetual winds from the equatorial to the tropical calms,—-
that the volume os air moved by these two upper currentS, North and South, to Cancer and to Capricorn, is
equal to the volume that is felt on the surface, as the N. E. and S. E. trade windS.

I know of no law of nature or rule of philosophy which would forbid the supposition that the air which
has been brought along as the N. E. trade winds to the equatorial calms, should after ascending there, return

by the counter and upper currents to the calm zone of Cancer, here descend and re-appear on the surface as
the N. E. trade winds again. I knew of no agent in nature which would prevent it tiom taking this circuit,
nor did 1 know of any which would compel it to take this circuit 3 but while 1 knew of no agent in nature that
would prevent it from taking this circuit, Ι knew on the other hand, of circumstances which rendered it proba·-
ble that such in general is not the course of atmospherical circulation-—that it does not take this circuit. Ι speak
of the rule, not of the exceptions; these are infinite, and for the most part are caused by the land.

And I moreover knew of facts which greatly strengthen the supposition, that the winds which have come
in the upper regions of the atmosphere from the equator, do not, after arriving at the calms os Cancer and
descending, return to the equator on the surface; but that they continue on the surface towards the pole.

Such are the circumstances which favor the conjecture that the winds which flow in the upper regions of
the atmosphere from the equator to the calms of Cancer, do not, aster arriving and descending in the midst of
these calmS, turn about and go back to the equator with the N. E. trades: on the contrary, the following are the
facts and circumstances which give strength to the supposition that these winds continue from the calm belt
os Cancer towards the pole, as the prevailing southwesterly winds of the extra-tropical North:

We have seen that on the North side of this calm zone of Cancer, the prevailing winds on the surface
are from this zone towards the pole3 in other words, if s represent the total volume of atmosphere which blows
on the surface towards the North on the vpolar side of Cancer, and 4 the total volume which moves on the

surface from the pole towards the calms of Cancer, then s being the rule and 4 the exception, we shall have

s> 4 = ε’. Therefore ε’ is the quantity which must return in the upper regions of the atmosphere srom the
Arctic regions to the calm zone of Cancer; and if we take δ” as the quantity which comes from the equatorin
the upper regions of the atmosphere to this same zone of calmS, we shall have the momentum of δ” equa] to

the momentum os ς’ as intimated by nature in the fact that she has established near each tropic, a zone, or

belt of calms.
