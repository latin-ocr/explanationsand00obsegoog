“ The waters 9? the ocean cover nearly three-fourths of the sui-face of the globe ; and os the thirty-eight
millions of miles of dry land in existence, twenty-eight millions belong to the northern hemisphere. The
mean depth of the ocean is somewhere about four miles—the greatest depth the sounding line has ever reached

is five and a quarter miles,* The mean elevation of the land, again, is about one thousand feet—the highest
point known to uS, is nearly as much above t'he level of the sea, as the great depth that has been measured,
is below it. The atmosphere‚ again, surrounds the earth like a vast envelope: its depth, by reason of the
tenuity attained by it, as the super-incumbent pressure is withdrawn, is unknown to uS,-but is guessed at
somewhere betwixt fifty and five hundred miles, Its weight, and its constituent elementS, have been deter-
mined with the utmost aecuracy. The weight of the mass is equal to that of a solid globe of lead sixty miles
in diameter. Its principal elements are oxygen and nitrogen gaseS, with a vast quantity of water suspended
in them in the shape of vapor, and commingled with these a quantity of carbon in the shape of fixed air,
equal to restore from its mam, many sold the coal that* now exists' in the world. In common with all
substanceS, the ocean and the air are increased in bulk, 3ηά consequendy diminished in weight, by heat ; like
all fluidS, they are mobile, tending to extend themselves equally in all directicnS, and to fill up depressions in
whatever vacant space will admit them3 hence, in these respects, the resemblance betwixt their movementS.
Water is not compressible or elastic, and it may be solidified into ice or vaporized into steam ι the air is elastic—
it may be condensed to any extent by pressure, 'or expanded to an indefinite degree of tenuity ΒΥ pressure
being removed from it—it is not liable to undergo any change in its constitution beyond these, by any of the
ordinary influences by which it is affected. These facts are few 3ηά simple enough—let us see what results
arise srom them. As the constant exposure of the Equatorial regions of the Earth to the Sun mu'st necessarily
here engender a vast amount of heah—and as his absence srom the polar regions must in like manner pro-
mote an infinite accumulation of cold,-to fit the entire Earth for ahabitation to similar races osbeingS, a con-
stant interchange and communion, betwixt the heat of the one and the cold of the other, must be carried on.
The ease and simplicity with which this is effected, surpasses all description. The air heated near the equator
by the overpowering influences of the Sun, is expanded and lightened: it ascends into upper space, leaving
a partial vacuum at the surface to be supplied from the regions adjoining. Two currents from the poles
towards the equator, are thus established at the sursace, while the sublimated air, diffusing itselfby its mobility,
flows in the upper regions of space from the equator towards the poleS. Two vast whirlpools are thus estab-
lished, constantly carrying away the heat from the torrid towards the icy regionS, and these becoming cold by
contaet with the ice, carry back their gelid freight to refresh the torrid zone. Did the Earth, as was long be-
lieved, stand still while the Sun circled aroundjt, we should have had two sets of meridianal currents blowing
at the surface of the Earth, directly from Nort'n and South, towards the equator, in the upper regions flowing

back again to the place whence they came. On the other hand, were the heating and cooling influeneeS‚ just
