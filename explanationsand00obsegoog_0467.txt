these six months is 24 days from 500 S., to the Line; whereas the mean passage for the others, or by the
eastern crossings is 26 days.

So too with the parallel of 250 S.: those crossings which were as far West as 900 οη this parallel, all
show better runs than do those to the East of it. The five os the first named months that fall within the cate·

gory of this last crossing, give a run of 23 days from 500 S. to the Equator‚ against 26 days by the six of the

latter. The July crossings of 250 S., (mean of six) are the most westerly; they are in 950, and give a mean
run of 23 days from 500 S. to the Line. The next crossings to the West are the January—meau of4 in 94ος
they give 22 days as the mean run from 500 S. to the Equator.

ln urging upon California bound vessels the importance of making westing about the parallel of 500 S.,
1 do not mean that they should expose themselves to heavy weather or contend against adverse circumstances

in order to get West on this part of the route; 1 simply mean that, ifa vessel, after doubling the Cape can steer
a W. N. W. course as well as a N. W. 3 or a N. W. as well as N. N. W. ; or a N. N. W. as well as a N. course3

that she should on all such occasions give preference to the course that has most westing in it, provided she do
not cross 500 S. to the westward of 1000 or thereabouts; nor 30⁰ S. to the westward of 12003 nor enter the S. E.
trade wind region to the West of the last named meridian. This is the western route. It is so called because
it requires you to keep as far West within certain limite, as well you may without running broad off to
make wesdng, or without fighting with head winds, or baffiing windS, or calinS, to get West.

The western route from Cape Horn to Calisornia is to be preferred by all vessels that double the “ Horn”
from May till October inclusive. This route lies well outfrom the land ; so that the influence of the land upon
the winds will not be as marked as it is at the same season along the eastern or usual route.

The sarther from the land, the more regular and steady the wind, may be safely taken as a general rule.

There is much more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere—and the action of the Sun’s
rays in our summer time upon this excess of *the land, very materially interfereS, as my researches abundantly
prove, with the regular course of the N. Ε. trades.

Where is there such a thing known as a regular mvnsoon in the Southern Hemisphere? The monsoons
of India and the China seas are due this excess of land in our hemi-phere. So are the African monsoons of

the Atlantic, the monsoons of the pacilio, and those of the Gilf of MexicO. They are all produced by the

action of the rays of the sun upon extensive deserts‚ or wide and arid plains in the Southern Hemisphere.

There may be a monsoon about New Holland‚ but we are speaking of what we know certainly to be the

case.

In the interior of North America, between the parallels of 3Οο and 4Οο Ν., there is an immense region of
country that is parched with drought during the suin-ner and fa113 the influence ofthis region is as Ι have be-
fore remarked, felt by the winds of the Galf of Mexic0‚ by the winds of the intertropie·2l regions of the Pacific
beyond Central America, and by the winds out upon the high seas, off the coast of California and Oregon 3—
these winds for many miles out to sea feel that influence, obey it, and assume the character inore or less of

monsoons during our summer and fall.
