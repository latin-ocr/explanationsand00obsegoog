Ι notice our ships have discovered a new region, new haunts sor right whales. They enter the Yellow
sea early in the season, and as it advances, they proce-ed North, through the Straits os Corea into the sea of
Japan3 thence North up the Gult’ of Tartary3 thence through the Perouse Strait into the sea os Seghalien;
thence up the Ochotsk, following the whales as they proceed North.

Others have passed up the sea of Behring or Kamtschatka, North through Behring’s Straits into the
Arctic sea, where whales are found large and plenty3 sea smooth, and weather in the summer months (from
the extreme length 'of the day) favorable for whaling. Several ships have been whaling successfully in those
parts. The polar whale (as it is called) yields very rich oil, and the bone is larger'and longer than that of
the Northwest Coast, and setches a better price in the market.

A free communication by our whalers through those remote seas, will develope the phenomenon of winds
and currents there ; they will als0, in cruising for whaleS, discover the hidden dangers, (if any‚) and thus con-

tribute to assist the hydrographer in preparing charts to guide future navigatorS.
Herewith 1 forward you a history of the sperm whale, by capt. F. Post os this city; also the history of

Nantucket, the once great whaling nucleus of the world, from which you can find many uscful statistics of

early whaling.''
History ‘ff the Spemnaceti Whale, by captain Francis Post.
“ It is a matter of much surprise, that, while the whale has been so long and so extensively an object of
commercial pursuit, so little should be ’generally known os the animal.
There is, perhaps, scarcely a being in the animal world, at least not one whose existence has been so long
⁴ known, the habits, structure and qualities os which are less known to the naturalist than are those of the whale.

Itis a very prevalent opinion that whales spout water—Morse, in his American Geography, tells us that

 

whales spout water to a great height, and we find many writers have been led into· the same error ; but it is .

well known among whalers that whales never spout water, and that their spouts which are simply dense respi-
. rations emitted with some sorce from their large nostril, never ascend above twelve feet high3 and when the
whale is unmolested, seldom to that height, or to one half of it. ο

The Spermaceti Whale has but one spiralle through which it respires, this is-on the left side os the upper
part os the head, and within a few inches of its end ; it is about fifteen inches long when closed and when ex·
tended, srom five to sim wide. The spout shoots obliquely forward and upwards, expanding when it rises like
a whiffof tobacco smoke, which it much resembles in form 3 it is visible but for a moment: is near the same
density as sog, and when blown in the face, the same degree os dampness is felt from it. When the air is clear
and cool, and a moderate breeze is blowing, so that the sea is not much ruffled, the spout of a large whale may
be seen from a ship's masthead the distance of nine mile3,—the white spout forming a fine contrast with the
blue field above which it rises, and appears at intervals of almost as much exactness as can be measured by a
first-rate chronometer. When whales spring out of the sea, the spray produced by their fall is so great as to
be seen 15 miles—in one of these playful gambols they are frequently first discovered.

The males of this species are out of all proportion the largest, and they are generally found alone; it is
