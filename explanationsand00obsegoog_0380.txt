Captain Sullivan to Licatenant Maury.

“ You will see by this abstract from my experience that an ordinary vessel in point of sailing stands but
little chance to cross the line in over 300 W., in the months of April, May, and first part of June. In any
other months 1 should think differently.

1 have had light airs, and could not have had better opportunity to judge of currente, to which 1 have
devoted my attention.

If this prove any benefit to you Ι shall be partially repaid for the long and tedious voyage.

With respect, 1 remain your most obedient servant.''

 

It will be observed that Captain Sullivan followed the new route faithfully to the Line, which he crossed
aster a passage of 30 dayS, in Long. 310 42¹, with the wind at East. That from the 15th to the 16th of April,
with the wind at E. S. E„ and wishing to steer Soutk, he made a course and distance good of 150 miles W.
N. W. ! and that from the 1'7th *to the zoth, with the wind srom the northward and eastweard, and as fairas be
could bave it to blow for his course to Ri0, he ran off away to the northward and westward instead of to the
southward and eastward, until he brought up in the mouth os the Amazon! Surely this is neither the fault of
the charts nor the route. The brig then beat about to the north of tbe line, and at the end of 78 days returned
to it again3 and on the 21st of June, succeeded in recrossing it in 310 52¹ ; -that is within ten miles of where
she had crossed it in April the first time.

With the winds now at S. E.—less favorable than they were the first time—she had no difficulty in clearing
St. Roque in 4 days from the line, and in getting to Rio in 13 days afterward. This “ mysterious hanging of
the brig about the line„ is certainly in no wise connected with the new route.

In justice to captain Goodrich of the “ Clarissa Perkin8,” it should be observed that he does not charge
his passage of 83 days to Rio to the new route. On the contrary, be distinctly shows that the fault was not
with the charts nor with the route, but with his passengers ; and with a candor that is in the highest degree
commendable, he himself admits his mistake in steering to the westward after crossing the parallel of 320 N.,
see his abstract, page 376, his winds and courses from February 16th to March 8th, and the remarks in brack-
ets, ( ), which are my own.

Captain G.’s log and remarks are of much value, and I take this occasion to express my thanks to him

for the information afforded by them.

 

Letter and Log of capt. Goodrich, of the ‘⁴ Oloris-m Perkins,’' to Lieut. Maury.
Rnamso, March 22, 1850.

“ A lew days since I sent you by private conveyance my journal of the ship “ Clarissa Perkin8,'' under
my command, from New York to San Francisco, srom thence to this port. 1 preferred to send the journal,

that you might see more fully than I could express in abstract form. -
