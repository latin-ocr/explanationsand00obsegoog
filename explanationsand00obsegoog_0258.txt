the almost total absence of gales in June and July, the scanty rains in the former month, and the abundance
os the materials from which these facts are drawn.

Contrasting t'nis with B, we find that J uly and August are the months which are most exempt froin storms
and rain, fogs and thunder3 that calms rarely occur in J annam, February, March and April, J uly and August,
October and November.

In district C, storms and rain seldom' occur in April, May, June and J uly. But it is needless to repeat

what the chart tells so plainly at a glance. Unamidable circumstances have conspired to delay the publication

of this interesting chart.

The Pilo't Charis.

Letter C of the series is a chart of the winds: it shows the point of the compass from which the wind
blows in all parts of the ocean, and sor every month in the year. The numbers of this series are called the
“ Pilot ChartS,” os which the North and South Atlantic, in two sheetS, each, and “ Coast of Brazil within
the Trade wind Region,’' in one sheet‚ and the sixth sheet of the South pacifica, have been published. Several
other sheetS, both of the Pacific and Indian oceanS, are in press, See Plate I, as an illustration of the manner
in which the figures for Plate V are obtained.

Sheets os this series ,are also in hand for the entire Pacific and Indian OceanS. Two, illustrative os
the Cape Horn passage, have also been sent to press,

'l‘he officere employed upon them from time to time have been Lieutenants Herndon‚ Dulany‚ H. N. .
Harrison, Ball and Forrest3 Passed Midshipmen Davenport, Powell, De Koven, Wainwright, Balch, RobertS‚
De Krast, Woolley, J ackson, Murdaugh, SemmeS, Johnson and LewiS, Brooke, wells, Terrett‚ and Professor
Benedict.

The “ Brazil Pilot'' is on a scale, to the square, of 20 of latitude by 10 of longitude, and extends from
the equator to 230 South.

The rest of the series, except the Cape Horn Pilots‚ is on a scale of 50 to 3 square: that is, the ocean is
divided off into districts os 50 of latitude by 50 of longitude. The Pilot Chart8‚ therefore, consist os a number
of engraved squar-es without regard to figure of the earth, with four inscribed concentric circles in each; and in

these circles are radii, drawn so as to represent every alternate point of the compass·card: thus; N.; N. N.
E.; N. E.; E. N. E.; East3 and so on around the compass. See Plate V.

After all the Log·books within reach have been examined, and the observations collated for this letter of
the series as in Plate 1, the results are collected for each district, arranged according to monthS, and entered
each set in its wind-rose, Plate V, as the circumscribed square with its concentric circles and points of the
compass is called. These entries are made in such 3 manner as to show at a glance the prevailing winds sor

‚any mouth in' any part of the ocean. Not only so ε the navigator sees at 3 glance how many days of observa·
