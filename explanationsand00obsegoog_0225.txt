at the mouth of the Thames, and it is not till the morning of the third day that this wave fills the channels of
the Thames, and wafts the merchandise of the world to the quays of the port of London. In the course of

this rapid Journey, the reader will have noticed how the lines in some parts are crowded together, closely on
each other, while in others they are widely asunder. This indicates that the tide wave is traveling with various
velocity. Across the Seuthem Ocean it seems to travel nearly 1,000 miles an hour, and through the Atlantic
scarcely less3 but near some of the shores, as on the coast os India, as on the east of the American Isthmus,
as round the shores of Great Britain, it travels very slowly3 so that it takes more time to go from Aberdeen
to London than over the aro os 1200, which reaches between 60Ο of southern latitude, and 60ο on the north of
the equator. These differences fail to be accounted for ; and the high waters are invariably found to exist
where the water is deep, while the low velocities occur in shallow water. We must, therefore, look to the
conformation of the shores and bottom of the sea as an important element in the phenomena of tides.”‘
According to Scott Russell's beautiful investigation of what he has called “The wave of the first order,
or the great wave of Translation,'’ we have the following rate as the velocity, in seas of given depth, of the

great tidal wave considered as a wave of the 'first order:

lt will be thus perceived, that there is an especial interest, and a peculial· value attached to deep-sea
soundings south of the great “Lands Ends'' of Australia, Africa, and Amerina, and it is earnestly hoped
that no American man-of-war will pass those regions without taking advantage of every opportunity for
trying the depth of the ocean, and doing all in her power to throw light, and diffuse knowledge upon a

subject that science in its marches, and man in his progr-ess, have invested with such a degree of interest.

Vessels that are bound around either of the Capes, are recommended to reserve their sounding twine
