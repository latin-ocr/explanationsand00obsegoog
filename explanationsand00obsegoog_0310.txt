and is impervious to 011 but the keenest instruments—-a cannon ball would hardly penetrate it. This part con·
taining the ease is also too unwieldly to be taken in whole, and to subdivide it would cause a loss, as much
thin 011 would escape3 hence it is necessary to raise it with the cutting apparatus perpendicularly up the ship’s
side, with its lower end remaining in and supported by the sea. A perforation iS‘then made in the upper end
with a spade and into this a bucket is placed which requires to be pushed down with a pole in order to tear
away the tetider membranous filiments that oppose its way3 the bucket is then filled with oil, and by means

of a pully is hoisted up and emptied into a receiver. In this way ten or twelve barrels of the oily liquid are

obtained from every whale of a large size. It is necessary that this oil should pass through the pots and be
heated to prevent its becoming rancid, though it may be mentioned that while fresh it is perfectly sweet, and
like other animal sats only becomes rancid through age. While fresh, it may be and is *sometImes used on
board ship for culinary purposes. A certain species of Yankee food called αιῖοιι(ι;·Ιι-711ιί.1·,” sried in fresh oil, occa-
sionally adds variety to the homely and too often scanty board of the whaler. N ext to the case, the J unk contains

in proportion to its bulk, the largest quantity of oily matter3 much of it yielding its own bulk in oil, and while

. 11 13 being cut into smaller pieces the 011 exudes so copiously that it is necessary to stop up the scupperS, and

bail it from time to time off deck. The blubber between decks is cut into small pieces so as to be conveniently
transferable, these are called “ horse pieces,⁷' and in this form the blubber passes through the mincing opera-
tion. This is performed by drawing a long knife across or nearly though the pieceS‚ cutting down portions
from a half to three quarters of 011 111011 thick3 these are not entirely severed, but for the convenience of removal
’are kept hanging together somewhat after the manner of book leaves·

In this state the blubber is ready for the try pots, into which it is transferred with a fork or pike construc-
ted for the purpose. A hot fite is kept up under the potS, and in an hour or less a pot full of blubber has all
the 011 fried out3 “the scrapS,'' -are then skimmed off ; more blubber is put into the pots and a sufficient
quantity of 011 13 boiled therefrom.

The 011 11011οἀ off is poured into a copper cooler, and from thence it runs through a cock into a second
coelet, and from this is bailed into casks which are placed about deck, and when the 011 13 perfectly 0001 the
casks are coopered and stowed away in the hold.

If the weather is fair and the sea smooth, a large whale may be fried out in about 36 hours, which gives
an average of from 2 to 3 barrels an hour; and is the whale be uncommonly sat, the 011 0011 110 extracted pro·-
portionably faster.

The scraps, it may be stated, form a sufficient quantity of fuel, for continuing the frying process; this goes
on night and day, the ship’s company being divided into two watches who perform duty alternately.

It is somewhat remarkable that in this age of invention, there has been no new method devised for capturing
whales 3 nor any improvement made on the old one, nor yet on the simple instruments used against them.

The plain harpoon employed hy the early whalers, is still i'n use, although there have been various modifi-

cations of this sorm3 such 03, harpoons with one flue, those with jointS, others barbed, &c., 820. But these

bave all had their day, and given way to the plain primitive harpoon.
