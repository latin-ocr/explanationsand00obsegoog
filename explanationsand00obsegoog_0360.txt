After reaching the meridian of 500 W„ Soutb is given as the course which a vessel will make on the
average thence to the parallel of 250.

But it should be. recollected that the tracks given in these directionS, and which every navigator who in-
tends to be guided by them, is recommended to project on bis chart, are in no case the traek which the vessel
herself is expected actually to make. Suppose a large number os vessels at different times should take this
route as their guide, the mean of all their tracks would be represented by the route which 1 recommend;
though perhaps it would not represent the track of a single vessel taken separately. Some would be on one
side, some on another; some would cross it in one place and some in another.

It is difficult to get navigators to comprehend this. Many of them think that to go the routes recommendet}
by me, they must actually run on the lines which I have drawn to serve merely as guides sor them, and for the

purpose of my own convenience in illustration.

Vessels that attempt to follow these routes will sometimes find themselves hundreds of miles on one side
or the other of the track as projected, and when they find themselves so driven off from the track as laid down
in the books, they should not attempt to get back upon the line itself as though it were a channel way, but
taking the direction in which it lies as a guide, and consulting the charts with which they are supplied, they
should shape their course and be governed accordingly.

‹ Every track that I have drawn shows that head winds may be expected along it, and when these head
winds are'encountered, the vessel so encountering must expect to be turned aside, and whether she should beat
or not, or stand off altogether upon this or that tack, the master must deci de, and he should be governed in
his decision by the sailing directions and the charts themselves,

With this general explanation for all the routes, navigators who try this J uly route min perceive that 1 do

qot recommend that they should, after reaching the meri dian of 500 W„ actually stretch away due South sor
590 miles until they reach the parallel of 250 Ν., where the wind will allow them to lay up to the southward
and eastward. ο

Suppose that a vessel on this route should, on reaching the meridian of 500 near Lat. 320 28², have the
wind to come out from S. E.—as she will find it to do on the average 12 times in lOO—she should not in this
case stand to the northward and eastward, because she would then run up into a part ot* the ocean where the
calms and light airs of the Horse Latitudes *are most vexatiouS. 1f she could not lie south, she should stand
down to the southward and westward until the wind hauls, or until she should reach the parallel of 310, and
then go about, taking care not to recross the parallel of 320 to the west os 450.

After crossing 300 N., strive not to sall to the westward of the projected track. Consider yourself in the
best possible position is you can cross the parallel of 250 N. between 400 and 450, or the parallel os 200 between

350 and 400. From either of these positions you will have no difficulty in reaching the meridiari of 300 οι· 310

between the parallels of 90 and 120 Ν., where you will lose the N. E. trades, you will then take the equatorial
calms, and they may hang-on you obstinately, {syon go muchfarlloer to the East ; but you will seldom or never

carry them with you below 60 Ν. Cross 60 N. by the shortest possible course. Losing these cal ωε, you will
