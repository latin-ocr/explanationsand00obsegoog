But the air is visible, and it is not easily perceived how either marks or tallies may be put upon it, that
it may be traced in its paths through the clouds,
The skeptic, therefore, who is hard of belief that the general circulation is such as Plate II represents it

to be, might consider himself safe in his unbelief‚ were he to declare his willingness to give it up the moment

any one should put tallies on the wings of the wind, which would enable him to recognise that air again and
those tallies, when found at other parts of the Earth’s surface.

As difficult as this seems to be, it has actually been done. Ehrenberg, with his microscope, has estab-
lished almost beyond a doubt, that the air which the S. Ε. trade winds bring to the equatur, does rise up and
pass over into the northern hemisphere.

The Sirocco or African dust which he has been observing so closely, has turned out to be tallies put upon

the wind in another hemisphere3 and this beautiful instrument of his enables us to detect the marks on these
little tallies as plainly as though those marks had been written upon labels of wood and tied to the wings of the
wind.

This dust, when subjected to microscopic examination‚ is found to consist of infusoria and organisms‚
whose habitat is not Africa, but South America, and in the S. Ε. trade wind region of South America. Prof.
Ehrenberg has examined specimens of sea dust from the Cape de Verds and the regions thereabout‚ from
Malta, Genoa, Lyons and the Tyrol, and he has found such a similarity among them, that would not have been
more striking, had these specimens been all taken from the same pile.

South American forms he recognises in all of them3 indeed they are the prevailing forms in every speci-
men he has examined.

Speaking of the dust which fell at Lyons‚ he says :—

“ The fact is very especially remarkable in this fan of dust, that, notwithstanding its agreement with the
Atlantic dust, which always showed dead and empty shells of organisms‚ the enuntia amphyooeis has often been

found with its gree-n ουατίεε, and therefore capable of li e.''

The following are the general results and characteristica of the new sirocco dust as announced by him z

“ 1. The dust of the sirocco hurricane of the 17th of October, 1846, at LyonS, differs from the ordinary
European and North African dust, but agrees entirely with the meteoric dust, which, since 1830, have been
observed inthe Atlantic ocean, near the Cape Verd IslandS, and in'the sirocco at Malta and Genoa. The
specimens of all these kinds are as though they were taken from one and the same well mixed package of dust,
although their highly various origin, and their innumerable multitude, are perfectly demonstrated.

u‘ 2. Besides, the direction of the wind, (which, according to the most recent and fortunate collections
and conclusions of meteorologists-Dove-—gives no indication of the source of the storm‚) no internel nor ex-
ternal evidence of the dust pronounces for its origin in Africa, but there are many forms there chiefly or wholly
native to South America. ·

“ 3. Moreover, the Lyons dust cannot have arisen from the far interior of a continent, but only from a

coast region, if it have generally a single origin, since it contains marine forms now living.
