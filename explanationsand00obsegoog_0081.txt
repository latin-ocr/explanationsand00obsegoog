might mete out the atmosphere in exact proportion to all the rest, and impart to it those properties and powers
which* it was necessary for it to have, in order that it might perform all those offices and duties for which He
designed it? I have not the time, and if 1 had the time 1 have not the beart so to abuse the patience of those
who read, as Ι should do, by attempting to discuss, at this time, the currents of the ocean, and to tell of the
beautiful discoveries to which our system of investigations has led us with regard to those great agents in

the terrestrial economy.

Harmonious in their action, the air and sea are obedient to law, and subject to order in all their move-
ments 3 when we consult them in the performance of their office3‚ they teach us Iessons concerning the wonders
of the deep, the mysteries of the sky, the greatness and the wisdom and goodness of the Creator. The

investigations into the broad-spreading circle of phenomena connected with the winds of heaven and the

waves of the sea, are second to none for the good which they do, and the profit which they give.
The Astronomer sees the hand of God in the sky3 but the right minded mariner who looks aloft as he

ponder-s over these things, hear His voice in every wave of the· sea that “claps its hands,'’ and feels His

presence ifi every breeze that blows.

Rea Foys and Sea Dm.

Every seamen has seen or heard of the “Sirocco dust'’ of the Mediterranean, and of the “African dust‚''

or “Red Fogs'² of the Cape de Verds and the adjoining ocean.
Thomas Ewbank, esq„ 'who administers the office of the United States Patent Office with so much ability,

has kindly furnished me with a description of stov-ms of “ African dust,'’ or “ sand,” as it is sometimes
called, which he encountered during a passage from Richmond, Va., to Rio de Janeiro, in the winter of

1845-6. He says: Ι
“ We had rough and wet weather for a fortnight or more. The roughest start for Rio, the Captain (an

old trader) had ever experienced. Few sights interested me more, on approaching and passing through the
flying-fish latitudes‚ than those beautiful and interesting creatures—indeed none, except superb oceanic skies,

some of which were so rich that 1 endeavored to preserve their features for an artist friend. Ι presume 'there

was nothing in them, gorgeous as they were, which had not been often seen by seamen3 but at one part of
the voyage, they changed in color and character, and, at length, so decidedly, as to excite the admiration
of both sldpper and crew—so rich and transcendently glorious and enchanting they became. It was, 1 Ο

believe, the introduction of a new pigment, so to speak, on the solar pallet, that wrought this wonder3
although Ι did not suspect this until some days had elapsed. The color which now overpowered and gave tone
to the celestial landscapes was that of a rich crcum- 1 could compare it to nothing else, while its tints varied
from fawn to pale white. It first was observed on the lOth of January, and disappeared on the 181h, leaving
as suddenly as it came. Nothing of the kind occurred again, either on the outward or homeward voyage.
