crossing in 1120 17'3· the “ Pigeon” 40 miles further to the east. At this time the “John Gilpin” had
dropped 260 miles astern.

Here Putnam osthe “ Pigeon ” again displayed his tact as a navigator, and again the fickle winds turned
against him. The belt of N. Ε. trades had yet to be passed3 it was winter; and by ‘crossing where she did,
she would have an opportunity of making a sair wind of them, without being much to the west of her port
when she should lose them. Moreover, it was exactly one year since she had passed this way before ; she
then crossed in 1090, and had a capital run os 17 days to San FranciscO.

Why should she not cross here again? She saw that the 4th Edition of sailing directions which she had
on board, did not discountenance it, and her own experience approved it. Could she have imagined that in
consequence of this difference of 40 miles in the crossing of the Equator, and of the two hours time behind her
competitor, she would fall into a streak of wind which would enable the “ Fish” to lead her into port one
whole week? Certainly it was nothing but what sailors call “ a streak of ill luck’' that could have made such
a diflerence.

But by this time “ John Gilpin‘’ had got his mettle up again. He crossed the line in 1160;—exactly two
days aster the other two—and made the glorious run of 15 days thence to the pilot grounds of San Fran·
cisco.

Thus end the abstract logs of this exciting race, and these remarkable passages,

The “ Flying Fish’' beat: she made the passage in 92 days and 4 hours from port to anchor3 the “ Gilpin''

in 93 days and 20 hours srom port to pilot ;† the “ Wild Pigeon” had 118. The “ Trade wind„ followed,
with 102 days, having taken fire and burned sor 8 hours on the way.

The result of this race may be taken as an illustration as to how well the winds and the currents os
the sea are now coming to be understood.

Here are tbree ships sailing on different days, bound over a trackless waste of ocean for some 15‚000 miles
or more, and depending on the fickle winds of heaven, as they are called, to wast them along ; yetlike travelers
on the land bound along the same road, they pass and repass‚ fall in with and recognize each other by the way3
and what perhaps is still more remarkable, is the fact that these ships should each, throughout that great
distance and under the wonderful vicissitudes of climateS, winds and currents which they encountered, have
been so skilfully navigated, that in looking back at their management, now that what is passed is before me, 1
do not find a single occasion on which they could have been better handled except in the single instance of the
“ Flying Fish’' while crossing the “ Doldrums’' in the Atlantic. And this mistake her own master was
prompt to discover, and quick to correct.

It is rare and deserving of note and commendation too, to find any ship so well navigated on such a long
voyage, and through such a variety of soenes, that, isit were to do over again, no departure from the course

actually pursued could be made for the better, except that very pardonable—because so natural—mistake os
