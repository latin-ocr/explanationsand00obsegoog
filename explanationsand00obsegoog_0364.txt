500, 3ηά then only between the parallels of 150 and 250 N. They sometimes blow in other parts of the ocean,
but it cannot be said that they prevail. '⁵

Endeavor to cross the meridian of 500, in September and October, before you do the parallel of 300 N. , 3ηά
do not consider yourself hopelessly to leeward, if you be forced to cross the parallelos 200 Ν., 33 far west as
longitude 450, or the parallel os 10ο Ν., 33 far as 360 or 370 W.‚ sor in September and October, as the Pilot
Charts show, you may frequently meet, between 10⁰ N. 3ηά the Equator, the S. E. trade winus.

The S. Ε. trades may be calculated on with certainty between 70 N. and 130 N., between 350 and 400
W. Occasionally the S. W. monsoons are found between the same paralleIS. The S. Ε. tradeS‚ when taken
in the northern hemisphere in this mouth, are frequently at S. S. E. ; and therefore it is not difficult sor vessels
that find themselves as far West as longitude 37 0 in latitude 100 Ν., to get to the eastward before crossing the
Line.

Between Long. 300 3ηά 350, the equatorial calms are found from 40 to 120 N. 3ηά between Long. 250
3ηά 300 they, 3ηά the S. W. monsoonS, are found from 120 to the equator3 3ηά 33 3 general rule they are
found more 3ηά more vexatious as you go east.

Captain Sinclair, when in command of the U S. Frigate “ CongreSS,” on her way to South America,
with that close observation of all the phenomena about him which gives a particular value to his remarkS, ob·
served the difficulties of crossing this belt far to the eastward. He crossed it in January‚ 1818, 3ηά infer-red
that there was a belt of monsoons between the two trades. He was mistaken as to the time of the year. He
crossed this belt in January, and though in January the winds are sometimes from the S. W., yet at that time
of the year, they have nothing of the character of monsoons about them.

1 quote a passage from his Journal:

“ We made a great run from their latitude (the Cape de VerdeS,) to about ’70 30’, when the N. Ε. Trade
began gradually to leave uS, which it did effectually before we reached the latitude of 60 301 North, having run
from 190 30', a distance of near 900 131133, between the 31st December and the 5th January, 3ηά from this time
to the 17th there was little else than a continued calm, except when occasionally disturbnd by a thunder squall
and violent rainS. Though considering we were at one time as far East as Long. 190 W.‚ we had very little rain
and very few squalls of wind3 those we had were principally from S. S. W. to W. S. W. 3 indeed there ap·
pears to be between the N. Ε. 3ηά S. Ε. Trade winds which we found to be from 60 30' North to the equator,
a light monsoon from the S. W.’' ,

Had this remark been made in the summer instead of the winter it would have been perfectly correct.

If after getting within these latitudeS, i. 3., those in which the calms are mentioned as prevailing, and
the wind should come out at S. E„ prefer the port tack3 sor before you make the land, you are almost sure to
have the wind out from the S. S. E„ when you can make your easting within the regions of the perpetual S.
Ε. trades.

After getting the S. E. tradeS, and finding himself 3 little pinched for easting to clear the land, the skilful

navigator will see that by standing on with the wind at S. E„ 311 the chauces are in bis favor. If the wind
