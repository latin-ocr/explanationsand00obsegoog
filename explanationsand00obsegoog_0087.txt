“ 1. The color and the whole exterior in all characterS, fineneSS, adhesiveness of parts, weight, are not in
the dry Tyro] snow-dust as in the ordinary atmospheric dust of stormS, but entirely and wholly similar to the
sirocco and Atlantic ‹lust-

“.2 The organic contents which so highly character-ise the Atlantic meteor- dust, and are similarly found
in the sit-occo· ·dust, are also found to agree in a very remarkable manner in the snow- -.dust

“The analysis already published of the meteor·dust, fallen from 1830 to 1847, in the harmattan or trades,
sirocco and fohn, show a great similarity m ‘the intermingling of organic particles⁸ Such an intermingling
might be expected a priori, from every storm- But that in all, similar particleS, and great numbers qf'daejfferev'tt
particle-³, should similarly occur, is very striking, and becomes yet more so when we consider that for seven-
teen years, and in dg‘fferent times of the year, they remain so similar that even the predominating forms numeri·
mlly, of one kind of dust, are also the predominating sonus in all the rest. That materials existing on the
surface of the earth are so similarly carried about by storms is not supposable, if we give up the highly im-
probable notion that all the hitherto investigated meteors and storms had their origin at precisely the same
limited locality of one and the same country. Wherever lise is found, the seasons of the year or of rains
alternate, and with them alternate, not only ιιι theory, but according to my own frequent and direct experience,
eiher the mode or the number of individual living forms. Considering the intermixture os marine animals,
their constant similarity m number, and the always recurring predominance of the same forms, we see that no
possibility remains of supposing that the meteor- dust, which the European sirocco and the German fohn wind
bring, and which covers the Atlantic Ocean only in the region ff the trades, even in the European-winter,
(January and February,) should always originate directly from the West [adies. Impossible as it is to conceive,

os all the storms now compared from 1830' to 1847, as having a continuous genetic connection, it is equally

“ impossible also to imagine the masses of dust transported by them, with such a degree ofsimilarity, not to have

α genecio connection.” ⁴* ⁴* ¹· ‘⁶ · Φ ²· ο ο 0 ο
“ The more,” continues this eminent microscopist, “the more Ι have busied myself with these examinations

of atmospheric dust, the more confident have 1 become that the subject is of great, manisold, and rapidly in-

creasing import : that it conflicts with not a few important and weighty ideas, and draws out and establishes

other new and important scientific notions. This ιε but the beginning of a future great department of knowl-

edge. 1 hope that the following attempt to deduce results from the observations which 1 have collected with

· some trouble and very great care and circumspection, may not lead to giving too great prominence to what rs

unimportant, nor fail to place what rs important in a light that may suggest farther and correct investigations

“ The name trade· wind dust was here first applied to the Atlantic meteor·dust. The connection ,of this with
the trade wind, and not vuith the harmattan, was definitely pronounced in 1816 by Captain Tuckey3 it was
made known and published from the Pmssian merchant-ship, captain Wendt, in 18303 in 1837, by Bennet,

and in 1839, by Captain Haywood. And Admiral Roussin separated the constant coast-cloud from the periodic

barmattan, in 1817. ll
