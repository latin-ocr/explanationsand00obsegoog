that this line, from the neighborhood of Bhering’s straits runs up in a northwesterly direction, and that it
probably lies along the line in which the currents from the rivers of Europe and Asia, probably many times
the volume of the Mississippi, meet the current around the North cape srom the Gulf of MexicO.

Again, after passing Bhering’s straits and feeling the effect of that powerful current, this line bends up in
a northeasterly direction.

The process may be supposed to be this-the ice which is forced in the current through Bhering's straits,
and in the general current sarther north towards Baffin's Bay, is broken to pieces by the agitation of the sea.
These pieces are gradually sloughed off from either current and arranged in the eddy between the two currents,
as we see drift-wood‚ δια, arranged by the side of counter currents in rivers and other sheets of water. The
spray now dashes upon these blocks of ice, they become frozen 3ηά cemented together, until by gradual ac-
caesion they form a compact and immense mass ospacked ice, for that is the term applied by seamen. This mass
therefore is probably not very broad. It may, aster attaining a certain height, be broken through either by the
pressure of the current whose course it has arrested, or by the violence of the windS, or the waveS, or by all
these forces acting together; so it is very probable that the sea within this barrier will be found free or nearly
free from floe icc—and comparatively smooth, for the barrier of ice will serve for a breakwater, or like a
coral reef, will shelter it from the winds and protect it from the forces of the swell on the outside.

Should a steamer, therefore, by Bhering's straits, succeed in passing through the first barrier of icc, she
would probably have the water so smooth that after a few days steaming, she would find herself up with the
icy barrier that would block her way into Wellington’s or some other of the straits that lead out into Baffin’s Bay.”

 

&tram from tloe Imtructiom issued by the Hm». Wm. A. Granum, Secretary ‘ff the Ναυῃ, to Lieut. De Itanon,
commanding the Grinnel expedition in search qs Sir Jolm stanklim.

“ You will, therefore, use all diligence and malre every exertion to this end3 paying attention as you go to
the subjects of scientific inquiry only so far as the same may not interfere with the main object os the expedition.

Having passed Barrow's straits, you will turn your attention northward·to Wellington Channel‚ and west·
ward to Cape Walker, aud be governed by circumstances as to the course you will take. Accordingly, you
will exercise your own discretim, after seeing the condition of the ice, sea, and weather, whether the two ves-
sels shall here separate, one for Cape Walker 3ηά the other for Wellington Strait3 or, whether they shall both
proceed together for one place or the other.

Should you find it impossible, on account of the ice‚ to get though Barrow's strait, you will then turn your

attention to Jones’ Sound and Smith’s Sound. Finding these closed or impracticable‚ and failing of all traces

of the missing Expedition, the season will be too far advanced for any other attemptS, and you will return to
New York. -

Acquaint, before saihng, and from time to time during the cruize, Passed Midshipman Griffin, sully with
allyour plans and intentions‚ 3ηά before you sail from New York appoint a place os rendezvous 3—change it as
