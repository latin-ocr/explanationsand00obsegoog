On the morning of the 13th‚ the wind having moderated sufficiently, we got under way, and, working
our way through some streams of ice, arrived in a few hours at Griffith's island, under the lee of which we
found our consort made fast to the shore, where she had taken shelter in the gale, her crew having suffered a
good deal from the inclemency of the weather. In bringing tc, under the lee of the island, she had the mis5
fortune to spring her rudder, so that, on joining υς, it was with much difficulty she could steer. To insure
her safety and more rapid progress she was taken in tow by the Advance, when she bore up with a fine breeze
from the westward. Off Cape Martyr we left the English squadron, under Capt. Austin.

About ten miles further to the west, the two vessels under Capt. Penny, and that under Sir John Ross‚
were seen secured near the land. At 8 p. m. we had advanced as far as Cape Hotham. Thence, as far as
the increasing darkness of the night enabled us to see, there was nothing to obstruet our progreSS, except the
bay ice. This with a good breeze would not have impeded us much; but, unfortunately, the wind, when it
was most required, failed uS. 'rhe snow, with which the surface of the water was covered, rapidly cemented
and formed a tenacious crust, through which it was impossible, with all our applianceS, to force the vessels
At 8 p. m. they cameto a dead stand, some ten miles to the east of Barlow's iulet.

The following day the wind hauled to the southward, from which quarter it lasted till the 19th. During
this period the 'young ice was broken, its edges squeezed up into hummockS, and one floe overrun by another
till it all assumed the appearance of heavy ice. The vessels received some heavy nips from it, but they sustained
them without injury. Whenever a pool of water made its appearance every effort was made to reach it, in
hopes it would lead us into Beechy island, or some other place where the vessels might be placed in security
for the winter. ‚

The winter set in unusually early, and the severity with which it commenced sorbade all hope of our being
able to return this season, and 1 now became anxious to attain a point in the neighborhood from whence, by
mma of land parties in the spring, a goodly extent of Wellington Channel might be examined.

In the mean time, under the influence of the south wind, we were being set up the channel. On the 18th
we were above Cape Bowden, the most northern point seen on this shore by Parry. The land on both shores
was seen much further, and tended considerably to the west of north. To account for this drift, the fixed ice of

Wellington channel, which we had observed in passing to the· westward, must have been broken up and driven

to the southward by the heavy gale of the 12th.

On the l9th the wind veered to the north, which gave us a southerly set, forcing us in at the same time
with the western shore. This did not last long, for the next day the wind hauled again to the south and blew
fresh, bringing the ice in upon us with much pressure. At midnight it broke up all around uS, so that we had
work to maintain the Advance in a safe position and keep her from being separated from her consort, which
was immovably fixed in the centre of a large floe.

We continued to drift slowly to the N. N. W. until the 22d, when our progress appeared to be arrested

by a small low island which was discovered in that direction, about seven miles distant. A channel of three

or four miles in width separated it from Cornwallis island. This latter island, tending N. W. from our position,
