It is yet within the recollection os most. navigatorS, how the traders from the New England States to the

West Indies used to find their way out, “ by running down the latitude” as it was called ; the practice was

to steer South until the latitude of their port was reached, and then to steer due West until they made the ¹

land. Their track waS, therefore, on the two legS, instead of along the hypothenuse of a triangle.

The cause os this practice was in the practical difficulty os finding longitude at sea3 for the general use of
chronometers on board ships is an innovation which the masters of that kind of craft had not learned, 20 years
agn, to tolerate.

Well might thermometrical navigatorS, therefore, when the chart appeared srom the Tower, giving the
longitude os the inner and outer edge os the Gulf Stream, liken those twolines to blue and red streaks painted
on the oceanlto show mariners their longitude.

At the time that Dr. Fanum made it known how navigatorS, simply by dipping a thermometer in the
water, might know when they entered, and when they cleared the Gulf Stream, Charleston had more com-
merce than New York, and all the New England States put together.

This discovery* changed the route across the Atlantic, shortened the passage from sixty to thirty days
coming this way, and, consequently, changed the course of trade also.

Instead of calling by Charleston as they came from England, vesseIS,aster this, went direct to the port of
their destination ; instead of running down to Charleston to avoid a New England snow storm, they stood off
for a sew hours, until they reached the tepid waters of the Gulf Stream, in the genial warmth of which the

crew recovered their frosted energies, and as soon as the gale abated, they were ready for another attempt to

make their haven.

In this way stations were shifted ; the northern ports became the half-way house, and Charleston an out·
side station.
This revolution in the course of trade commenced about 1795. It worked slowly at first, but in 1816-17,

it received a fresh impulse from J naaman Tnouesou, Isaac Wmonr, and otherS, who conceived the idea of
establishing a lin‘e'os packets between New· York and Liverpool. This was at a period when the scales of
commercial ascendancy were vibrating between New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other placeS. The packet
ships os the staid New York Quaker turned the balance. · Though only of 300 or 400 tons burden, and sailing but
once a month, they had their regular day of departure, and the merchants of Charleston, Philadelphia, etc.,
found it convenient to avail themselves of this regular and stated channel, for communicating with their agents
in England, ordering goodS, etc. 'fhose packets went on increasing in numbers and size until now, at the
present day, we have them measuring 2000 tonS, sailing every day, and running between New York and every
fifth-rate sea-port town in the United State8‚ and to many foreign portS.

Thus an impulse was given to the prosperity os New York3 one enterprise begat another, until that city

‘Though it was Dr. Franklin and captain Folger, who first turned the Guls Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there

in the oixteonth century.
