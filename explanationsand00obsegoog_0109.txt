culation by the continual flapping of the ship’s saiIS, it would be almost insufferable. No person, who has not
crossed this region, can form an adequate idea of its unpleasant effectS. You feel a degree of lassitude
unconquerable, which not even the sea bathing, which every where else proves so salutary and renovatin g,
can dispel. Except when in actual danger of shipwreck, I never spent twelve more disagreeable days in the

professional part of my life, than in these calm latitudes.
“ I crossed the Line on the 17th o‘f January, at 8 A. M„ in longitude 210 20', and soon found I had sur-
mounted all the difficulties consequent to that event ; that the breeze continued to freshen and draw round to

S. S. E„ bringing with it a clear sky and most heavenly temperature, renovating and refreshing beyond

description. Nothing was now to be seen but cheerful countenances, exchanged as by enchantment‚ from ’

that sleepy sluggishness which had borne us all down sor the last two weeks.”

In a clear day at the equator, this· cloud-ring having slid to the North or South with the calm belt, the
rays of the Sun pour down upon the crust of the earth and raise its temperature to a scorching heat. The
atmosphere dances above it, and the air is seen trembling in ascending and descending columns with busy
eagerness to conduct the heat off, and deliver it to the regions alost, where it is required to give momentum to
the air in its general channels of circulation. The dry season continues3 the Sun is vertica13 and finally the
earth becomes parched and dry 3 the heat accumulates faster than the air can carry it away 3 the plants begin
to wither, and the animals to perish. Then comes the mitigating cloud-ring. The burning rays of the Sun
are intercepted by it. The place sor the absorption and reflection, and the delivery to the atmosphere of the
solat heat is changed ; it is transferred from the upper surface of the Earth to the upper surface of the cloudS.

Radiation srom the land and the sea below the cloud belt is thus interrupted‚ and the excess of heat in
the Earth is delivered to the air, and by absorption carried up to the cloudS, and there delivered to their
vapors to prevent excess of precipitation.

In the mean time, the trade winds North and South are pouring into this cloud-covered receiver, as the
calm and rain belt of the equator may be called, fresh supplies in the shape of ceaseless volumes of heated air
loaded to saturation with vapor, which has to rise above and get clear of the clouds before it can commence
the process of cooling by radiation. In the mean time, also, the vapors which the trade winds bring srom the
North and the South, expanding and growing cooler as they ascend, are being condensed on the lower side
of the cloud stratum, andtheir latent heat is set free, to check precipitation and prevent a fiood.

While this process and these operations are going on on the nether side of the cloud-ring, one not less
important is going on on the upper side. There, from sunrise to sunset the rays of the Sun are pouring down
without intermission. Every day, and all day long, they operate with ceaseless activity upon the upper surface
of the cloud stratum. When they become too powerful, and convey more heat to the cloud vapors than the
cloud vapors can reflect and give off to the air above them; then with a beautiful elasticity of character, the
clouds absorb the surplus heat. They melt away, become invisible, and retain, in a latent and harmless state,
until it is wanted at some other place and on some other occasion, the heat thus imparted.

We thus have an insight into the operations which are going on the equatorial belt of precipitation,
