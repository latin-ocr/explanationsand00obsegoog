Along the polar borders os these two calm beltS, we have another region of precipitation, though generally

¹”the rains here are not so constant 33 they are in the equatorial calmS. The precipitation near the tropica}

calms is nevertheless sufficient to mark the seasons3 for whenever these calm 30333, 33 they go-frorn North

to South with the sun, leave a given parallel, the rainy 333303 of that parallel, 'if it be in winter, is said to
commence. Hence we may explain the rainy scason in Chile at the South, and in Calisornia at the North.

This letter of the series of the charts will enable any one who con‘sul'ts it, to tell to ⁴what places the tropical

‘ calms bring rain, and in what months the rainy season commences and ends sor any parallel.

To complete the physical examination of the earth’s atmosphere, which we'have' supposed 'an astronomer
in 033 of the planets to have undertaken according to the facts developed by the wind 3ηά current chartS, it
remains for him to turn his telescope upon the icy regions of the poles, (For, that we should complete the ex-
amination in this respect, it would be necessary to obtain the log books of ships in the anti-commercia] regions
‘of the ocean, which we cannot do. As the sea is most open near the South pole, the principle of the general
law of atmospherical -circulation would be better developed probably by observations in the Antarctic, than in
‘the Arctic regions.)

For the want of such observations, but with= the light'which these charts throw 03 the' subject sor our
guide, let us pursue thc S. W. passage winds ofthe northern' hemisphere into the Arctic regions, and see

'theoretically,'with the imaginary telescope, how they g'etth'ere3 and being there, whatbeco'mes‘of them.
’From the parallel of 400 up towards the North pole,‘the 'prevailing'win'dsin the northern hemisph'ere as
already remarked, 'are the S. W. passage winds, or as they are more generally called by mariners ‘the

“Westerly” winds; these, in the 'Atlantic, prevail over the “ Easterly'’'winds in* the ratio of abo‘ut two

to bne.

Now, if we suppose, and such is probably the case, these “ Westerly’' winds to' convey in two days a
greater volume os atmosphere towards the Arctic circle than those “ Easterly„ winds can bring back in one,
we establish the necessity for an upper current by'which this difference ‘may be⁴ returned to the tropical calms
‘os our hemisphere. Therefore, there must be some place in the ‘polar regions at'which‘th‘e'se S. W. winds 03333
'to go¹ North, and from which they commence their return to the South, and this 'locality must be in a region

peculiarly liable to calms. 1t is another atmospherical node ‘in' which the motion 'of the air‘ is upward, with a

''decrease of barometric pressure. It is‘¹marked P, Pla'te 11.

Π we now 'return to the calm belt of “the northern tropic, a'nd ‘trace theoretically a' portion· of air that· in
is circuit shall fairly represent the average course of these S. W. passa‘ge winds, we³shall s'ee that it approach'es
the pole in a loxo'dromic curve3 that as it approaches the 'pole it acquires from'the spiral convolutione of this ·
curve which represents its path, a' whirling motion, in' a‘ 'direction 'contrary to'that'bs'the hands of a clock,
and that the portion of atmosphere whose path 'we are ‘followingjwould gradually· c'ont‘ract its gyrations, until
it 'would finally ascend,'turning against the hands* of 3 watch, as it whirls around.

After 'reaching the upper 'regions of the' atmo'sphere, through' this'whirl, its course' ‘would be to the south·

‘'ward3 'or rather, ὅπως to the effect of the 'axial ro'ta'tion of the e'ar‘th, its course' x'vv'ou'ld2 be from the northward

and eadward, until it should meet also in the upper regibus a'like ‘portion frbrri 'the' ascending node fon-‘med in
