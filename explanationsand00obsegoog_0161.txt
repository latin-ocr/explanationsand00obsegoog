being held in this uncomfortable position by the heavy masses which had been forced under her bottom.—
She retained this position until she finally broke out in the spring.
We were now fully launched into Baffin’s bay, and our line of drift begun to be more southerly, assuming

a direction nearly parallel with the western shore of the bay at a distance of from forty to seventy miles from it.

After an absence of eighty-seven days the sun, on> the 29th of J anuary, raised his whole diameter above .

the southern horizon and remained visible more than an hour. All handS, on seeing an old friend again, gave
vent to their deligbt in three hearty cheers.

The length of the days now went on increasing rapidly‚ but no warmth was yet experienced from the
sun's rays ; on the contrary the cold became more intense. Mercury was congealed for several days in Feb·
ruary3 also in March 3 which did not occur at any other period of the winter. A very low temperature was
invariably accompanied with clear and calm weather, so that our coldest days were perhaps the most pleasant.
In the absence of wind-we could take exercise in the open air without feeling any inconvenience from the
oold. But with a strong wind blowing it was dangerous to be exposed to its chilling blasts for any length of
time, even when the thermometer indicated a comparatively moderate degree of temperature.

The ice around the vessel soon became again cemented and fixed, and no other rupture was experienced
until it finally broke up in the spring and allowed us to escape. still we kept driving to the southward along
with the whole mass. Open lanes of water were visible at all times from alost3 sometimes they would be
formed within a mile or two of us.

Norwhales, seda, and dovekeys, were seen in them. Our sportsmen were not expett enough to procure

any except a few of the latter, although they were indefatigable in their exertions to do so. Bears would be
frequently seen prowling about, but only two were killed during the winter3 others were wounded, but made
ο their escape. A few of us thought their flesh very palatable and wholesome, but the majority utterly rejected
it. The flesh of the seal, when it could be obtained, was received with more favor.

As the season advanced, the cases of scurvy became more numerous ; yet they were all kept under con·
trol by the unwearied attention and skilful treatment of the medical officers. My thanks are due to them,
especially to passed assistant surgeon Kane, the senior medical officer of the expedition. 1 often had occasion
to consult him concerning the hygien of the crew, and it is in a great measure owing to the advice which he
gave and the expedients which he recommended, that the expedition was enabled to return without the loss
of a man.

By the latter part of February, the ice had become sufficieutly thick to enable us to dig a trench around
the stem of the Rescue, deep enough to ascertain the extentos the injury she had received in the gale at
Griffith’s island. It was not found to be materia13 the upper gudgeon alone had been wrenched from the
stern·post; it was adjusted and the rudder repaired and made ready for shipping when it should be required.
A new bowsprit was also made sor her out of the sew spare spars that we had left, and everything made sea·
worthy in both vessels before the breaking up of the ice.

On the first of April a hole was cut in some ice that had been forming since our first besetment, in Sep·
