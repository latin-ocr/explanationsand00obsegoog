sought to ascertain what is the mean height of the barometer at Lima and along the Peruvian coast of Sonth

America.

lt appears that the mean height os the barometer at Lima is, according to Ductor Unanue, 29.13, (27
pulgadas, 4 line03,) with a variation in its range of from 2 to 4 lineas (01111810ο olna-37.)

He says the barometer rises 2 lineas in the summer, and falls as much in winter. Assuming the mean‘
height of the barometer at the sea level in 031130 10 be 3oin.‚ Unanue's mean reading would give 765
feet as the height of Lima above the sea.

But according to a level run for the rail road between the two placeS, the height of Lima above the sea
level of Calla0, is only 496 feet, and until it was thus run, the height of Lima above the sea was generally as-
sumed at what the barometer would make it, viz: about 750 feet.

The change in the barometric pressure due a height of 496 feet, is one-third of an inch‚ and this correc-
tion being applied to the Lima barometer of Unanue to reduce it to the sea level, would ¹make the mean read·
ing of the barometer at Callao to be 29.46 t thus confirming this conjecture, (so sar as these scanty observa-
tions g0,) that the barometric pressure along this part of the coast, is less than that due its latitude and eleva·
tion. Admitting these conjectures to be truthS, we derive a practical rule, that the height of a chain of moun-
131113 determined by barometric pressure depends upon the way the wind blows.

If the standard sor comparison be placed at the foot of the mountain on the windward side, the height os
the mountain will appear-too great; and if it be placed on the lee side, the height of the mountain will be too
low.

Lima is sar enough, or nearly far enough, South to be beyond the reach of the diminished barometric
pressure due the belt os equatorial calmS. But Lima may be under the hollow, 01· depression caused in the
atmosphere by the Andes, or rather in consequence of the obstruction which these mountains oppose to the
Trade Winds. The effect of this obstruction, as before explained, is to cause a banking up in the atmosphere
on the windward side of the Andes, (as there was found to be over Nauta,) and a depression in the air on their
100 side. Whether Lima is under the axis of this atmospherical valley or not, or whether it is on one side or
the other of its axis, is a question for actual observation to decide. I shall certainly look sor lower barometers
in vessels coasting along the shores of Peru, than I would in vessels crossing the same parallels of latitude,
but at a considerable distance out to sea.

Upon the same principle, and for the same reason, 1 should expect to find in Southern Chile and Western
Patagonia a bank of atmosphere to windward of the AndeS, and adepression to leeward—the lee side in
this place being the Eastern, and the windward side the western side—of the Andes.

Now, Lima is in the range of ¹permanent trade winds, and Lieut. Herndon, by assuming the barometer at
the sea level of Callao,· to be 30.019, would, after leaving that city, make the heights of all places
determined by him, from 210 to 380 feet too high with regard to the Pacific, depending, of course, upon the
season of the year ; for the fluctuations os the barometer here are periodical as well as diui-nal.

At Para, at the mouth of the Amazon, where we have a low barometer not from mountain agency, but
