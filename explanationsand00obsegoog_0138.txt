which produces an under current from the Mediterranean‚ and an under current from the Red sea into the ocean,
should produce an under current from the ocean into the north polar basin—it being supposed merely sor the
present that there is a surface current through Davis' StraitS, always setting out of the Polar sea. In each case
the hypothesis with regard to the part performedby the salt in giving vigor to the system of oceanic circulation

requires that, counter to the surface current of water with less salt, there should be an under current of water

with more salt in it.
p That such is the case with regard both to the Mediterranean and the Red sea, has been amply shown in

other parts of this work, and abundantly pro-ved by other observers.

That there is a constant current setting out of the Arctic ocean through Davis’ and other straits there·
about, which connects it with the Atlantic ocean, is generally admitted. Lieut. Di: Ham, U. S. N.‚ when in
command of the American expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, was srozen up with his vessels in the main
channe] of Welington straits ; and during the nine months that he was so frozen‚ his vessels holding their
place in the ice, were dristed with it bodily sor more than a thousand miles towards the south.

The ice in which they were bound was of sea water, and the currents by which they were drifted were
ossea water—only, it may be supposed, the latter were not quite so salt as the sea water generally is,

Then since there is salt’always flowing out of the north polar basin, there must be salt always flowing into
it, else it would either become fresh or the whole Atlantic ocean would be finally silted up with salt.

It might be supposed, were there no evidence to the contrary, that this salt was supplied to the Polar seas
fi’om theAtlantic around North Cape, and from the Pacific through Bhering’s straitS, and through no otherchannels.

But fortunately Arctic voyagerS, who have cruised in the direction of Davis' straitS, have afforded us proof
positive as to the factos this other source for supplying the Polar seas'with salt. They tell us of an under cur·
rent setting from the Atlantic towards the Polar basin. They describe huge icebergs with tops reaching high
up in the air, and of course the basis of which extend far down into the depths of the ocean, ripping and tearing
their way with terrific force and awsul violence through the surface ice or against a surface current.

Passed Midshipman S. P. Gau-rm, who commanded the Brig “ Rescue,'' in the American searching expe-
dition after Sir John Franklin, informs me that on one occasion the two vessels were endeavoring to warp upto
the northward in or near Wellington channel, against a strong surface current, which of · course was setting to the
south 3 and that while so engaged, an iceberg with its top many feet above the water, came “ disting up,'’
from the south, and passed by them “like a shot,'' although they were stemming a surface current against
both the berg and themselves· Such was the force and velocity of the under current, that it carried the berg
to the northward faster than the crew could warp the vessel against a surface but counter current.

Capt. Duncas, Master of the English whale ship Dundee, says, at page 76 os his interesting little narrative,

“ Dec. 18tla, (1826 )--1t was awful to behold the immense icebergs working away‘ to the northeast from us
and not one drop of water to be seen 3 they were working themselves right through the middle os the ice.''
