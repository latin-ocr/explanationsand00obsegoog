After passing it, and getting with a rising barometer the S. E. tradeS, and finding them, as is osten the
case, at S. S. E„ then the navigator having a breeze, can make Easting. At any rate it is better to
attempt to make Easting ΒΥ beating against the S. E. tradeS, than by fanning along with light airs and calms,
in the “ Doldrums. ” Theresore‚ the Sailing Directions advised him to dash right across this calm streak,
stand boldly on, take advantage of slants in the wind, and by this device, make Easting enough to clear the land.
So, sorgetting that the charts are founded on the experience of great numbers who had gone before him,
Nickels being tempted, turned a deaf ear to the cantion, and flung away three whole days and more, of most
precious time, dallying in the “ Doldrums.''

He spent four days about the parallel of 30 Ν., and his ship left the “ Doldrum8‚” after this waste of
time, nearly upon the same meridiari at which she entered them.

She was still in 340, the current keeping her back, just as fast as she could fan East. After so great a
loss, her very elever master, doubting his owrnjudgment‚ became sensible os his error, and leaving the spell bound
calms behind him, entered in his log as follows :—“ I now regret, that after making so fine a run to 50 N. , that 1
did not dash on, and work my way to windward to the northward cf St. Roque, as I have experienced little or
no westerly set since passing the equator‚ whilst three or four days have been lost in working to the Eastward,
between the latitude of 50 and 30 N. against a strong westerly set ;” and he might have added, “ with little
or no wind.‘'

In three days after this, he was clear of St. Roque. Just five days before him the “ Hazard ’' had passed
exactly in the same place, and gained two days on the “ Fish’' ΒΥ cutting straight across the “ Doldrums, ’³
as the sailing directions advised him to do.

The “ Wild Pigeon” crossing the equator also in 330, had passed along there, 10 days before, as did
also the ‘⁶ Trade Wind,’' 12 days after. She crossed the Line also to the West of 340, and in four days
aster had cleared St. quue, which certainly is a great deal better than stopping in the “Doldrums '’ to fight
with baffling airs.

But, notwithstanding this loss of three days by³ the “ Fish,” who so deeply regretted the mistake, and
who afterwards so handsomely retrieved herself, she found herself on the 24th November alongside of the
“ Gilpin,'' her competitor. They were then both upon the parallelos 50 south, the “ Gilpin” being 37 miles to
the Eastward, and of course in a better position, for the “ Fish” had yet to take advantage of slantS, and
stand off shore to clear the land.

The charts show-ed the “ Gilpin '’ now to be in the best position, and the subsequent events proved the
charts to be right, for thence to 530 S. the “ Gilpin’' gained on the “ Pigeon ’² two days, and the “ Pigeon '’

on the “ Fish '' one.

But the “Pigeon” and the “Fish’' dashed through the straits of Le Maire; the “Gilpin’' going

around. For the benefit of those who follow in this route, 1 quote the Le Maire passages of both z
From the “ Wild Pigeon’s '' Log.
