“ Hitherto only such spirals have been constructed in which the current in every winding shows an e«

“ But Ῑ 111311 10 arrange spirals of the following kind t—one of them is in such a way constructed that
“ two copper wires are soldered, 10 33311 of them, fifteen thin wires covered over with silk. The first wind
“ backwards over the copper wire, i. e. the first convolution of the helices, beginning at the end and proce
“ ing towards the centre, is with all the fifteen wireS, the second winding is only wound with 14 111133113, wh
“ the fifteenth is carried along the 31113, 833. ; consequently every convolution of the fifteen windings ha
“ thread less, and the ends of all the other threads have direction of the axiS. The ends of the fifteen thret

“ are soldered in the middle, and the two thick wires without touching each other, are so bent that they 1

“ 113 suspended in the little cups of the apparatus of Ampere, then a current passing through the spiral v
“ divide itself in such a manner that itis most strong on the external ends of the spiral but decreases m(
“ and more to the middle. If the windings of the spiral took place in the direction of the hands of a wate
“ then the end of it where the ctu-rent enters will become a 803111 pole, but a aVortlz pole, kept parallel 10 1
“ spiral, will repel it, only the final convolution will be attracted, and it represents the disengaged magnetis
“ of the final surface.’'

“ A second spirat is wound like that described, only with this difference, that the strongest convolutioz
“ are in the middle, and the feeblest near the 311113. Τ1113 spiral will be attracted by the North pole of a magn
“ over the half in which the current moves at first or 3111313, 1131 1113 other half will be repulsed by it. Tl
“ third spirat 1133 1113 winding the same strength over the whole extent3 it is indifferent to a magnet pole whic
“ is not too near and only the final convolutions are attracted or repulsed.”

“ Therefore it is permitted to enlarge 1113 theory of Ampere in this manner:

“—If an electric current passes through a spiral in the direction of the hand of a watch‚ and,

“ a If the current is more feeble in every winding as it is 'nearer to the centre of the spiral, then that haj
⁴‘ is attracted by a South pole in which the current 3111313, except the first winding.

“ b But if the current is stronger in every winding as it is nearer 10 1113 centre of the spiral, then that hal
“ is repulsed by a South pole in which the current 3111313, including the first winding.

“ The contrary will be the case sor that half in which the current leaves the helix, and likewise for th(
“ North pole of the magnet opposed.’'*

Attentively considering 'the experiments of the Professor of Griefswald, we may trace 311 analogy between
his spirals and the spirals which the currents of the wind in “his circuits” describe about the Earth. At the
803111 polar calms, the atmospherical spiral is with the hand of the watch, and as in the case of a spiral so
wound about its helix the magnetism is South polar3 and so mutatis mutandis for the regions of North polar
