terminated abruptly in an elevated cape, to which Ι have given the name of ‘⁶ Manning,'' after :1 warin pero
sonal friend and ardent supporter of the expedition. Between Cornwallis island and some distant high land
visible in the north, appeared a wide channel leading to the westward. A dark misty-looking cloud which
hung over it, (technically termed “ frost-smoke'') was indicative of much open water in that direction.

This was the direction to which my instructionS, referring to the investigations at the National Observa·
tory, concerning the winds and currents of the ocean, directed me to look for open water.

Nor was the open water the only indication that presented itself in confirmation of this theoretical con-
jecture as to a milder climate in that direction. As we entered Wellington charmel, the signs of animal lise
became more abundant, 3ηά Captain Penny, commander of one of the English expeditions, who afterwards
penetrated on sledges much farther towards the region of the frost-smoke than it was possible for us to do in
our vesseIS, reported that-he actually arrived on the borders of this open sea.

Thus these admirably drawn instructionS, deriving arguments from an enlarged and comprehensive sys-
tem of physical research, not only pointed with emphasis to an unknown open sea, into which Franklin had
probably found his way, but directed me to search for traces of his expedition in the very channel at the en-
trance of which it is now ascertained he had passed his first winter.

The direction in which search, with most chauces of succeSS, is now to be made sor the missing expedi·
tion, or for traces of it, is no doubt in the direction, which is so clearly pointed out in my instructionS.

To the channel which appeared to lead into the open sea, over which the cloud of frost·smoke hung as
a sign, 1 have given the name of Maury, after the distinguished gentlemen at the head of our National Ob·
servatory‚ whose theory with regard to an open sea to the north is likely to be realized through this channel.
To the large mass of land visible between N. W. to N. N. E. Ι gave the name of Grinnell, in honor of the
head and heart of the man in whose philanthropic mind originated the idea of this expedition, and to whose
munificence it owes its existence.

To a remarkable peak bearing ·N. N. E. from us distant about forty mileS, was given the name of Mount
Franklin. An inlet or harbor immediately to the north of Cape Bowtlen was discovered by the commander
of the Rescue, in his land excursion from Point InneS‚ on the 27th of August, and has received the name of
Griffin inlet. The small island mentioned before was called Murdaugh‘s island, after the acting master of the
Advance.

The eastern shore of VVellinglon channel appeared to run nearly parallel with the western3 but it bet-ame
quite low, and being covered with snow‚ could not be distinguished with certainty, so that its continuity with
the high land to the north was not ascertained.

Some small pools of open water appearing near uS‚ an attempt was made to get the vessels into thern.
The Advance was moved about fifty yardS, but our combined efforts were of no avail in extricating the Rescue
from her icy cradle. A change of wind not only closed the ice up again, but threatened to give us a severe
nip. We unshipped her rudder and placed it out of harm’s way.

September 23d was an uucomfortable day; the wind was from the N. E. with snow. From an early hour
