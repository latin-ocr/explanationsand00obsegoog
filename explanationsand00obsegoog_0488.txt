wind are decidedly W. S. W., S. W. and S. E.; and in June W., W. S. W., S. W. 3ηά Ν. W. But as the
favorite point is west, and calms are not so frequent as in May, June appears to be a more propitious mouth
than May for crossing the parallel of 50 N. by a southwardly course from Panama. Between 50 3ηά 100 N.

for the other months. 1 have not observations enough to the east of 800 to justify me in any remarks as to

the winds.

Neither have I observations enough sor January, February, or March to the east of 800 3ηά between 00
3ηά 50 Ν., to authorize deductions 3 but for all the other months of the year, they are abundant. They show
that to the east of 8Οο between the equator and 50 Ν., the winds are steady between S. E. by the south to
west, and that calms are most frequent in this part of the ocean during the months of December and April..
The points from which the winds most prevail are, in December S. W.; in April S. S. W. and S. W.; in
May, June, and July, S. W. ; in August, S. S. W. and S. W. ; in September, S. W.; in October and No·
vember from S. Ε. to W. S. W.

Between 800 3ηά 850 West from the equator to 50 Ν., the prevailing direction of the wind 311 the year,
is between S. E. and West by the way of South3 though from March to August, inclusive, it is most inclined
to be variable. In December, March, and April calms are most frequent.

Between 850 3ηά 900 the prevailing quarter. for the wind, all the year, from the {quator to 50 Ν., is
between S. Ε. 3ηά S. W. It is most variable from J anuary to June, inclusive. In March 3ηά April, the N.
Ε. trades are frequently found here—calms are most prevalent in March.

Continuing West between the same parallels, the region from 900 to 950 West, seems to be of all, the
most liable to calms the year round. From October to January inclusive, they are not so frequent as in the
other months, being less frequent in October.

From S. E. to S. S. W. is the ruling quadrant for the winds here all the year3 though from January to
June inclusive, they go from N. Ε., around by the way of East, to West.

To the West of 950 they are steady between S. E. and South, except from January to May inclusive.
In January, February, and= March, they often get as far North as N. E. and in April and May as far as E. N. E.

Now then, after carefully studying this description of the wind, derived, it is true, from no great abun-
dance of materiaIS, 1 have to suggest the following routes for the consideration of navigators bound⁴ northwest
from Panama.

From the Bay of Panama make the best of your way South until you get between 50 Ν. 3ηά the Equator.

Being between these two parallels, it will be for the navigator to decide whether he will shape his course west,
and keeping between them until he crosses the meridian of 95⁰ West, or whether he will cross the Equator, and
make his westing in South latitude, with the Southeast trades on his quarter. The winds that he finds between
5⁰ and the Line should decide this question for him. If he can get west here, with a good breeze, he should
crack on, and when his good wind leaves him, steer S. again.

If the passage from Panama be attempted in January, February, March, April, May, or June, time will
probably be saved hy going South of the Equator3 for at this half of the year the Northeast trades and the
