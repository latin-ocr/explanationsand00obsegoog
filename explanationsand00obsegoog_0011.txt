The wind and rain; the vapor and the cloud ; the tide, the current, the saltness and depth, and tempera-
ture and color of the 333; 1113 3113113 of the sky ; the temperature of the air3 the tint 3311 shape of the clouds;
the height of the tree on the shore, the size of the leaveS, the brilliancy of the flowers ;÷each and all may be
regarded as the exponent of certain physical combinationS, and, therefore, as the expression in which nature
chooses to announce her own meaning3 or if we please, as the language in which she writes down 1113 opera·
tion of her own 13313. To understand that language, and to interpret aright those 13313, 13 1113 object of the un·-
dertaking which those who co·op 31313 with me have in hand. No fact gathered in such a field as this, therefore,
033 come amiss to those who tread the walks of inductive philosophy, for in the hand-book of nature, every such
fact is asyllable, and it is by patiently collecting fact after fact, and by joining together syllable after syllable,
that we may finally seek to read aright from the great volume which 1113 13311331 31 333 3311 1113 philosopher on
the mountain see spread out before them.

Dr. Buist, a learned and eminent suvant of India, has drawn 3 beautiful picture of the field in which
navigators are so earnestly invited to labor and 13311 111311 help.

In the report on the affairs of the “Bombay Geographical Society,’' presented hythe Secretary 311113
annual meeting, in May, 1850, 1113 Doctor remarks: “The Assistant Secretary of your society? Mr. Macfarlane,
has made considerable progress in the construction of Wind and Current Charts, founded on the informa·
tion supplied by ships’ logs, and on the principle of Lieutenant Maury. Itis more 11133 probable that besides ’
1113 03113313 occasioned by the trade-winds, monsoons, and set of the tides, 313 have a group of movements
intermingled with those dependent mainly 03 evaporation. When it is remembered 11131 03 1113 western
shore of the Arabian sea, including in this the Red sea and Persian ‘gulf, from· the line northward, we have
an expanse of coast of not less than 6,000 131133, 3311 3 31131011 of country’of probably not less than 100 miles
inland from 11113, where the average fall of rain does not amount to four inches annually, where not one-half
of this ever reaches the sea, and where, to the best of our knowledge, the evaporation over 1113 00333 33313833
31 least a quarter of an inch daily, all the year round, 01 01033 03 318111 feet annually, some idea of the enor-
mous abstraction of water in the shape of vapor may be formed. On the assumption that this extends no
further, on an average, than 50 311133 out to sea, we shall have no less than 39 cubic miles of water raised
annually in vapor from the northern and northwestern side of the basin, which must be supplied from the open
ocean on the South or the rain 03 1113 Ε331. The fall of rains on the western side of the ridge of the moun·
tain chain, from Cape Comorin to Cutch, averages pretty nearly 180 1301133 annually, and of this at least
160 13 03111311 off 10 1113 sea: that on the Concan to ’70 1301133, of which probably 30 11031 off to the ocean:
or betwixt the 1310, over an area of twenty miles from the sea-shore to the ghauts‚ and about 1200 miles
from the North to the South, or an area of 24,000 square miles in all, we shall probably have an average dis-
charge of nine feet, or close on forty cubic miles of water,-an amount sufficient, were it 301 diffused, to raise

the sea on our shores three feet high, over an area of 72,000 square 131133.
