Sailiny Directions from Panama to Galg‘sornia and tlte Northwest.

The passage under canvass from Panama to Cal‘ifornia as at present made, is one of the most tedious,
uncertain, and vexatious that is known to navigatorS.

The voyage from Valparaiso to Calisornia is a shorter one, in point of time, than is that from Panama,
though the latter, as it regards distance, is not half as long as the former.

A brother officer of the Navy, writing from San FranciscO, says ε

“ Ι learned, on my arrival at Panama, that great numbers of sailing vessels were in the habit of resorting
thither sor the purpose of taking passengers and freight to San Francisc03 but to my surprise. 1 heard that
they seldom made the passage under 90 dayS, and often were 120 days on the way. There werethen many

vessels there, all ready to sail, and among'them the clipper ship ‘Hornet,’ none of which has yet arrived

’ though 53 days have intervened.

“ One of the clippei· ships sometime since made the passage in 45 dayS, by standing to the southward as
if bound to Callao, and making all her westing in the S. E. tradeS, south of the line. This is such a round

about way of getting to San Francisco from Panama, that there must be something ‚wrong in the courses steered

by the vessels which take the northern passage. lt is well known that there is a strong westerly current run-
ning past the Galapagos IslandS, which, by my own experience on one occasion, Ι found to be sixty miles in
24 bours. This current extends to the eastward almost to Point Male, and westerly entirely across the Pacific,
though not so strong as in the vicinity of the GalapagOS. It strikes me that navigators with proper instruc-
tions as to this current and the prevailing windS, ought always to make this passage in certainly not more
than 40 days. ,

Knowing that you had few if any abstracts of this passage, Ι took the liberty of telling Capt. Goodrich
that these logs would be valuable to you, and suggested that he get as many of them together as possible and
send them to you.’'

That this voyage can, with a better knowledge of the winds and currents than navigators now posse88‚
be shortened very considerably, 1 have no doubt.

xBut, unt'ortunately‚ only a few of the vessels in the Panama trade, send me abstracte of their
loge.

As soon as 1 can collect materials enough to justify a discussion of this passage, Ι will undertake it. In
the meantime, drawing upon such slender sources of information as Ι chance to have, 1 venture the following. ·
suggestions as to the route srom Panama to the northward and westward. 1 say suggestions, for my informa-
tion is not sufficient to justify the application of the more positive term of “ Sailing Directions ” to the remarks
1 have to make.

Ι have more than once, while preparing this work, called the attention of navigators to the system os

monsoons off the Pacific coast of Central America. It is this system of monsoons and the calms or “ Equa-

toria] doldrums '' as they are called, which are always to be found between the N. E. and the S. E. trade winde
