The Indian ocean is the fountain of another stream of warm water which fiows South, and a branch of
which is the well known Lagullas current.

With the information to be derived from the Abstract Log-books with whichI hope every American
navigator that visits those seas will furnish me, Ι see reason for the anticipation of great improvements in the
navigation there—particularly in the navigation between New Hollaud and India3 and between India, China,
and the Cape of Good Hope.

The discovery has already been made, that in certain parts of the China seaS, each month almost has a

system of winds peculiar to itself. Thus the winds between the parallels of 150 and 200 N., and the meridians
of1100 3ηά 1150 Ε. are:

 

 

 

In Dec., between N. and N. E. inclusive. Sept., around the Compass.

May, around the CompasS.

June, between S. E. and S. W. Lat. 150 3ηά 200 Ν., Long. 1150 and 1200 Ε.
July, “ S. and S. W. Dec. to April, btw. N. and E.

June, between S. E. and S. S. W. May and June, Variable.

July, “ S. and S. W. July and Aug., btw. S. S. W. and S. W.
August, “ S. and W. S. W. ⁶ Sept. and Oct„ Variable.

These facts have been clearly brought out by these investigations; and that such are the differences with

regard to the winds in different parts of this ocean, and at different seasons of the year, there is no more doubt

than there is as to the fact that the monsoons change. ι
, Some few masters of merchantmen, I am aware, have refused or'withheld co·operation in this undertaking
upon the plea that I have some theory of my own which I am seeking to build up by these charte.

They are mistaken; Ι set out with no theory3 3ηά Ι have none to build up. 1 set out with the view of col·
lecting factS, of‘gathering and presenting side by side the experience of every navigator with regard to the
winds and currentS, and the phenomena of the sea—of taking the records thereos from all the Log books
1 could obtain—and os discussing them, that Ι might ascertain not from the reports of one or two seamen, but
os a multitude, the prevailing winds for every month in every part of the ocean3 and in the manner of
doing this, I have been governed altogether by the principles of inductive philosophy.

And to satisfy navigatore as to the confidence which is due the results thus obtained and announced, Ι
will explain the process by which those above quoted as to the winde in the China sea, were obtained3 for
