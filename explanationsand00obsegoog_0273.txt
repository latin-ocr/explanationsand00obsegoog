Fahrenheit, is less than the area comprehended between the isotherms 500 and 600 ; and this again less than
the area between this last and 7003—f0r the same reason that the area between the parallels of latitude 500 and
600 is less than -the area between the parallels of latitude 400 and 50ος and they indicate that theoretically
more rain to the square inch ought to fall upon the ocean between the colder isotherms of 100 difference, than

between the warmer isotherms of the same difference.

Thus, to make myself clear: the aqueous isotherm of 500 in its extreme northern reach, touches the

parallelos 600 Ν. Now, between this and the equator there are but three isotherm83 600, 700 and 800,

with the common difference of 100. But between the isotherm of 400 and the pole, there are at least five otherS, .

viz: 400, 300, 200, 100, 00, with a common difference of 100. Thus to the North of the isotherm 500, the
vapor which would saturate the atmosphere from zer0, and perhaps far below, to ‘near 400, is deposited3 while
to the South of 500 the vapor which would saturate it from the temperature of 500 up to that of 800, can
only be deposited. At least such would be the case if there were no irregularities of heated plainS, moun-

tain ranges, land, δια, to disturb the laws of atmospherical circulation as they apply to the ocean.

Having therefore theoretically at sea, more rain in high latitudeS, we should have more clouds: and there-
fore it would require a longer time for the sun, with his feeble rays to raise the temperature of the cold water,
which, from Septemffiar to J anuary, has brought the isotherm of 600 from latstude 560 to 400, than it did for

these cool surface currents to float it down.

After this southward motion os the isotherm of 600 has been checked in December by the colrl, and aster
the sources of the current which brought it down have been bound in fetters of ice, it pauses in the long nights
of the northern winter, and scarcely commences its return till the sun recrosses the equator, and increases its

power, as well in intensity as in durationz

Thus we have here, for the first time beautifully developed, the effects of night and day, of clouds and

sunshine, upon the currents of the sea. These effects are modified by the operations of more powerful agents
which reside upop the land ; nevertheleSS, feeble though those of the former class may be, a close study of the

thermal charts will indicate that they surely exist.

Now returning towards the South z—we may on the other hand, infer that the mean atmospherical tempera·
ture sor the parallels between which the isotherm of 800 fluctuates, is below 800 at least, (pr the nine months
of its slow motion. This vibratory motion suggests the idea that there is probably somewhere between the
isotherm of 800 in August, and the isotherm of 600 in J anuary, a line or belt of invariable, or nearly invaria-
ble temperature, which extends on the surface of the ocean, from one side of the Atlantic to the other. This

line, or band, may have its cycles alm, but they are probably of long periodS.

Theoretically, such a line ought to be found for any given year, but its place for one entire year may not

cojncide with its place for another, though the motion of such a belt from year to year would probably be very small.

The observatione upon which these charts are founded run through a period of half a century ; conse·
quently they show the temperature for the months only, without regard to the year, and therefore they do
