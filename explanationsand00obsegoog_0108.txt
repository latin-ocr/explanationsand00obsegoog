here that the elasticity of feeling which he breathed from the trade wind air, has forsaken him.

‘Escaping from this gloorny region, and entering the S. E. tradeS, his spirits revive, and he turns to 1
Lug-book to see what changes are recorded there. He is surprised to find, that notwithstanding the oppn

the clear weather on either side of them3 that just before entering, and just before leaving the rainy paralle]
the mercury of the thermometer and barometer invariably stands higher than it does when within tbem, ev·
