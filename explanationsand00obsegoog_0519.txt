550 or even farther South, to 'prevail with great regularity and force ; moreover they are accompanied by that
long rolling swell which will ofitself help a vessel along many miles a day.

Capt. Cave of the ‘⁸ Helena,” the only Australian bound log that I have yet received, took these wester-
ly winds in Lat. 320 8., Long. 270 W. and with the exception of two days near the ,Cape of Good Hope‚
did not record a wind with easting in it‚—but for one day—thence to Port Philip. From the meridian of the
Cape in Lat. 390, he had a run of 27 days to the golden land. He kept along nearjhe parallel of 410 and

averaged about 5 degrees of longitude a day.
The “ Helena's '’ lug affords a very good illustration as to the mistake which the Australian bound trader

is very apt to make by supposing that his route through the South Atlantic lies along the usual track of ves-
sels bound around the Cape of Good Hope. The Austrahan route is not the Old India route any further than

the Polar edge of the S. E. tradeS.

With the view of illustrating this fact as well as the route, 1 quote the “Helena’s” abstract log
from July 15111, taking her up in her greatest longitude West aster crossing the Equator, which she did
July 4th, longitude 310 3Ο’ West. She morcover appears to have found the belt of “ Horse Latitudes„
South‚ quite broad, sor she was in baffling winds from 200 to 270 8., (5 days.)
