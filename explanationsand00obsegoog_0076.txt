These calm 3ηά trade wind regions or belts, move up and down the earth, annually in latitude nearly a
thousand miles, In July and August, the zone of equatorial calms is found between 70 N. and 120 N.;
sometimes higher3 in March and April, between latitude 50 S. and 20 N.

With this fact, these points of view, and 1113 Trade Wind Chart before 118, 11 18 easy to perceive why it is
that we have a rainy season in Oregon, a rainy and dry 8338011 111 Calisornia, another at Panama, two at Bogota‚
none in Peru, 3ηά 0113 111 Chile.

In Oregon it rains every mouth, but more in the winter months·

The winter there is the summer of the southern hemisphere, when this steam engine is working with the
greatest pressure. The vapor that is taken up by the S. E. trades, is borne along over the region of N. E.
trades to latitude 350 or 40Ο Ν., where it descends and appears on the surface with the S. W. winds of those
latitudeS. Driving upon the highlands of the continent, this vapor is condensed and precipitated during this
part of the year, almost in constant showerS.

In the winter, the calm belt of Cancer approaches the equator. This whole system of zoneS, viz: trades,
calms and westerly windS, follow the Sun3 3ηά they of our hemisphere are nearest the equator in the winter
and spring months than at any other season.

The S. W. winda, backing down at this season to the South, reach 38 far down as the lower part of cali·
fornia. In winter and spring the land in California is cooler than the sea air, and is quite cold enough to
extract moisture from it. But in summer and autumn the land is the warmer, 3ηά 03111101 condense the vapors
of water held by the air. So the same cause which made it rain in Oregon, now makes it rain in California.
As the Sun returns to the North, 113 brings the calm belt of Cancer and the N. E. trades along with him ; and
now at places where six months before, the S. W. winds were the prevailing winds, the N. E. trades are found
to blow. This is the 0383 111 1113 latitude of California. The prevailing winds then, instead of going from a

warmer to a cooler climate as before, are going the opposite way. consequently, they cannot, if they have

the moisture in them to make rains of, precipitate it under such circumstances·

Panama is in the region of equatorial calma. This belt of calma, as may be seen by the 0113118, travels
during the year back 3ηά forth over about 170 of latitude, coming further North in the summer, where it tarries
for several 1110111118, and then returns so as to reach its extreme southern latitude some time in March or April.
Where these calms are, it is always mining, and the chart shows that they hang over the latitude of Panama,
from June to November3 consequently, from June to November is the rainy season at Panama. The rest os

the year, that place is in the region of the N. E. tradeS, which, before they arrive there, have to cross the

‚ mountains of the isthmuS, 011 1113 0001 tops of which they deposita their moisture, and leave Panama rainless and

pleasant, until the Sun returns North with the belt of equatorial calms aster him. They then push the belt os

N. E. trades farther to the North, occupy a part of the winter zone and refresh that part of the earth With
summer 131118.

Τ1118 11311 of calms moves over more than double of its breadth, andthe entire motion from South to North

is accomplished generally in two months, May 3ηά June.
