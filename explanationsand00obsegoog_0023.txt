Sm :—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 19th inst„ enclosing a communicationi
from the Chai-ge d’Affaires of Great Britain to the Secretary of State of the United StateS‚ with certain other

papers and documents, relative to a proposition by the British Government, to the effect that the Government

with the Royal Engineers engaged upon like ’duties on foreign stations, according to the plan set forth in
the “Instructions for taking meteorological observations at the principal foreign stations of the Royal Engineers‚”
drawn up by Major Genera] Sir John Burgoyne‚ Inspector General of Fortifications.

1 am directed by you to state “whether such co-operation could be made at the Naval Observatory with·
out interference with other duties, or making any material changes in any arrangements which may now be in
’ use there for similar purposes ;” als0‚ to give my “views whether any useful ‹zo-operation, direct or indirect,
could be furnished by our vessels at sea, with the instruments usually furnished to them ; or at any of our
Navy Yards‚ either with their present instruments, or by the aid of others to be furnished for that purpose3 and
if so, at what yards such observations would be most desirable, having regard to the observatione of this
,kind which are known to be made at different places, in connection with the Smithsonian Institute and public

observatories.” ’

In reply, it gives me pleasure to state that the desired co-operation can be made at this Observatum, and
