·‘ In the season of February, March, April, and May, there is no difficulty in making the passage from
Porto Praya to Ambriz in thirty dayS, provided the run from Porto Praya to Monrovia takes not more than
eight days· ⁸
The direct route, and that which approaches the great circle, leads along the coast, touching the outer
soundings os St. Ann’s shoaIS, thence to Half-Cape Mount, to allow for a current when steering for Monrovia.

From there, follow the coast along with the land and sea breezeS, assisted by the current, until you arrive at

Cape Palmas ; keep upon the starboard tark notwithstanding the wind may head you in shore, (the land breezes
, will carry you off,) and as the wind permits, haul up for 2ο West longitude ; cross the equator here if conve-
nient, but 1 would not recommend going to the westward of it, you will encounter westerly currents from thirty
to fifty miles a day. In the vicinity of Prince’s Island the S. W. wind is always strong. In the latitude of
about 10 30‘ N. there is a westerly current. Should it not be practicable to weather the Island of St. Thomas,
stand on, approach the coast, and you will meet with North winds to carry you directly down the coast. Our
Salem vessels make the passage from the United States in 56 dayS, arriving at Ambriz in May. I have made
three different cruizes to this coast in the same season, in the Marion, John Adams and Perry.

The impulsive desire to attain the object of our duty will, as much in nautical matters as otherS, mislead
our better judgment, when there is a prospect, or any temptation to succeSS‚ without experience to sorewarn
us. Thus, our vesseIS‚ after arriving at Cape Palmae, have generally gone upon the port tack, because the
wind carried them towards the coast or Gulf of Guinea, and seemed to favor them for the port tack the most;
which, on the contrary, although slowly veering towards the S. Ε., was hauling more ahead, and leading them
off into a current, which, under a heavy preSS, it is impossible to work against. The consequences were, they
had to go upon the starboard tack, and retrace the ground gone over. On the starboard tack, as you proceed
easterly, the action of the wind is the reverse, and it allows you to pursue the great-circle course.

It employed the Marion eighty-odd days to Kabenda, a port 2οὸ miles nearer than Ambriz; to which port

(Ambriz) from Monrovia, in this vessel‚ (the Perry,) we went in 23—making 31 from Porto Praya. In the
