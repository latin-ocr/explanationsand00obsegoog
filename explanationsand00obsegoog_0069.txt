GENERAL CIRCULATION ΟΡ THE ATMOSPHERE. 63

and returns thence—we will suppose sor the present only—back towards the North pole, as G, until it reaches the
calms of Cancer, where it descends and is felt on the surface as H, the S. W. passage wind3 and so the circuit
is completed for the' northern hemisphere. -

The Bible frequently makes allusions to the laws of nature, their operation and effects. But such allu-
sions are often so wrapped in the solds of the peculiar and graceful drapery with which its language is occa-
sionally clothed, that the meaning, though peeping out from its thin covering all the while, yet lies, in some
sense, concealed, until the lights and revelations of science are thrown upon it3 then it bursts out and strikes
us with the more force and beauty.

As our knowledge of Nature and her laws has increased, so has our understanding of many passages in

the Bihle been improved. ,
The Bible called the Earth “the round world,’' yet for ages it was a most damnable heresy for Christian
men to say, the world is round ; and, finally, sailors circumnavigated the globe, proved the Bible to be right,

and saved Christian men of science from the stake.

‘⁸' Canst thou tell the sweet influences of the Pleiades ?''

Astronomers os the present day, if they have not answered this question, have thrown so much light upon
it as to show that, if ever it be answered by man, he must consult the science of astronomy.

It has been recently all but proved, that the Earth and Sun, with their splendid retinue os comas, satellites
and planets, are all in motion around some point or centre of attraction inconceivably remote, and that that

point is in the direction os the star Alcyon, one os the Pleiades! Who hut the astronomer, then, could tell their

‘⁸ sweet influences ?’'

And as sor the general system of atmospherical circulatim, which I have been so long endeavoring to de·

· scribe, the Bible tells it all in a single sentence: “ The wind goeth towards the South and turneth about unto

the North ; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuitS.'' Ecc. i, 6.
A like operation takes place in the southern hemisphere. We now see the general course of the “ wind

in his circuits,'' as we see the general course of the water in a river. There be many abradiug sursaceS, irregu-

larities, etc., which produce a thousand eddies to the main stream, yet, neverthelesS, the general direction of
the whole is not disturbed nor affected by those counter currents; so with the atmosphere and the variable
winds which we find here in this latitude.

We see, aIsO, that there must be about the habitable parts of the earth at least three zones or nodes, in which
calma and light airs are the prevalent condition of the air. One of these zones is near the equator, where the

northeast and southeast trade winds meet, and form what is called the belt of equatorial cairus.
The other zones lie between those parallels where the “wind that goeth towards the South’' meets that
which “turneth about unto,the North.’' They are the Calms os Cancer and of Capricorn. (See Plate II.)
About each pole we have, or, according to the views I have been endeavoring to make plain, we ought to
have, a perpetual whirl of the wind in the ascending nodes there. I have endeavored to represent them hythe

direction of the curved arrows at the poles, P and P, (Plate ΙΙ.) Here then are two more nodes: five
in all.
