FROM THE: CAPE DE vssnns ΤΟ mli: 8. W. COAST 01? flvmen. 343

John AdamS, 10 to Monrovia, and 46 to Ambriz, by the way of Prince’s Island3 about 10 of which was lost
working to the south of Cape PalmaS. From Cape Palmas to the point of crossing the equator the current
is easterly—south of that westerly. ’

The practice along the coast in this vessel (the Perry) waS, to keep near enough to the land to have the

advantage of a land and sea breeze, and to drop a kedge whenever it sell calm, or, we were unable to stem

the current. Upon this part of the coast near the Congo, the lead line does not always show the direction of
the current which affects the vessel. On the bottom there is a current in an opposite direction from the sur-
face3 therefore, before dropping the kedge‚ the better way is to lower a boat and anchor her—which will show
the drist of the vessel. Between Ambriz'and the Congo, Ῑ have seen the under current so strong to the S.
E. ‚ as to carry a 24 pound lead off of the bottom‚ while the vessel was riding to a strong S. W. current—but
the under current is the strongest.

In crossing the Congo, I would always suggest crossing close to its mouth, night or day; going North
with the wind W. N. W., steer N. N. E. , with a five or six knot breeze‚ when you strike soundings on the
other side you will have made about a N. ᾖ E. course in the distance of 9 miles, ·by log from 114 fathoms off
Shark Point. The current out of the river sets West about 2 knots the honr. With the land breeze it is
equally convenient3 and may be crossed in two hours. In coming from the North, with Kabenda bearing N.
E„ in 13 fathoms, or from the latitude of 50 48¹—wind S. W., a S. S. E. course will carry you over in four
hours outside of Point Padron-and by keeping along shore the current will assist you in going to the South.
Vessels which cross to seaward from latitude of 50 45, and 90 W., are generally six days or more to Ambriz;

by the former method it occupied us (the Perry) only two dayS.”

Lieut. Muury to tlte Secretary of the Navy.

1 have the honor to report to you, for the benefit os navigation, the accompanying “ Notice to Mariners‚”
which is derived from the “ Wind and Current Charts,’' in process os construction at this office.

1 ‘would recommend that all vesseIS, whether public or private, bound hence in the months named, to ports
in the Pacific, Indian, or South Atlantic Ocean, should try these routes, because they are derived from the re·
sults of many thousand voyageS, and are, in fact, the combined experience os thousands of navigator&

These routes therefore are not dependent upon any theory3 they are the results of actual observation. If
the navigators who have furnished me with copies and abstracts of their logs have (and they doubtless have)
reported correctly the direction of the winds encountered by them, then there is no doubt asto the practicability
of these mutes· The advantages which they offer are of commercia] and national importance.

Avessel that pursues them, instead of the old or usual route hence to the equator, will save from one
thousand to fifteen hundred miles in distance, and gain on the average from a week to ten days that far on the
passage to the ports os India, China, South America, California, and all the markets of the Pacific Ocean.
