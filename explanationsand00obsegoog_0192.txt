“ December 16tlz.—For several days past we have been overhauling the line, re·knotting it, and waceng
it3 to·day we made another experiment3 the line run well, and parted at 1‚6oo sathoms. 1 have no doubt
that the wax was os service to it, but the line is not suitable‚ and we did not dcem it expedient to try it again
to·day.

“ Lat. oba. 21ο 34’ Ν.; Long. chr0. 630 24’ W. Temp. air 840, temp. water 81⁰. Time the line
was running out, 28 minute8.’'

“ December 29th, 1850.—-Since our last soundingS, we have visited St. ThomaS, Santa Cruz‚ and Ponce.
We arrived at St. Thomas on the next day, after taking the last sounding; the run from St. Thomas to Santa
Cruz occupied about four hours only, and the passage from Santa Cruz to Ponce was made in the night.
We are now on our way from Ponce to St. Domingo. This asternoon we hove to opposite that portion ot‘ the
Mona Passage between the west end of Porto Rico and Mona Island. We were successful in getting bottom,
beyond a doubt, and the fact settles the question of our former experimentS, and proves that we lawe never
before got bottom. 1 judge entirely stom the strain upon the line, after the shot stopped3 the drift of the ship
was sufficient to part it, and the strain was unlike any we have had before. Lat. 170 54¹ N., Long. chro.
670 28¹ W. ],200 sathoms of waxed line run out3 drift about half a mile 3 time of running out, 17 minuteS.
Temp. air 81ος temp. water 840. One shot expended.

“ January etth, 1851.—This morning we left San DomingO, and at noon being becalmed about nine miles
from the land, we took advantage of the opportunity to get soundingS. We got bottom with 370 sathoms up
and down; time of running, 5 minute8.' Lat. 180 201 Ν., Long. 690 49‘ W. Temp. air 800; temp. water
820. Line waxed. One shot expended.

“ January 5tl2, 1851.-At 4 Ρ. M. got another sounding. The line was waxed3 it ran 19 minuteS, and
stopped at 1,275 fathoms; got bottom, without doubt. Altavela in sight, Lat. 1Ἷο 16’ N .‚ Long. 710 26³1
W. Temp. air 820 ; temp. water 820. One shot3 drist, about half a mile.

“January 13tlz, 185l.—Yesterday we sailed from Aux CayeS. Hove to at noon this day, and made three

unsuccessful attempta to get soundings.
“ The lst shot ran about two minuteS, and the line parted at 250 fathomS.
“ The 2d shot ran about three minutes, and the line parted at 300 sathomS.
“ The 3d shot ran 18 minuteS, and the line parted at 1,200 fathom8‚ waxed line.
“ Lat. obS. 190 12’ Ν., Long. chro. 760 05' W. Temp. air 8303 temp. water 820.

“ January 14th, 1851.-ve1y fresh wind, and the sea running too high for sounding.
t· January loth, 1851.-—Same as yesterday.

tt January loth, 1851.-At 3.30 Ρ. Μ. sent a boat to board a wreck lying upon the Colorados Rees3 took

advantage of the opportunity to sound‚ and got bottom with 420 fathoms line. Time of running 5 minutes;
temp. air 820 ; temp. water 8003 Lat. 22⁰ 29' N., Long. 840 35’ W.

‘⁸ Attempted to verify the above cast, and in so doing the line parted at 280 fathomS.

“ On the next attempt a smart squall came up, causing us to drift very rapidly‚ and rendering the opera·
tion so uncertain that the result is not worth sending.
