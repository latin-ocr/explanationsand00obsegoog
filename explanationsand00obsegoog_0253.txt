Rule.-To find the time of the highest water sor a certain day, take the time of moon’s meridian passage
for the upper and lower transit os that day and subtract half an hour from both these times, If one of those
times sall between the given limits of the month, then this time will be the time of the highest water, and the
other transit time will be the time of the smaller high water of that day.

Example.—On a certain day in June, (limits between 20 hours and 3 hours,) for the times of moon’s
meridian passage are found sor the upp er 3ηά lower transit ὲ,- 10 hours 3ηά ss 22 hours. Then ss 22 hours lays
between the given limits for June, and it will be highest water at ss 21} hours 3ηά the smaller highwater at 10
bonrs, the other transit time.

Ruta—But is those transit times do not sall between the given limits then that limit number will bc the ’
time of the highest water, which is nearest to one of the transit times, and still the other transit time will be the
time of the smaller highwater.

Example.-On a certain day in June (limits between 20 hours and 3 hours) the times, of meridian passages
are found to be d: 4 hours and ὲ,- 16 hourS, then the highest water will be at 3 hourS, because this limit
number is nearer to ss 4 hours than 20 hourS, the other limit number, is to ss· 16 hours the other transit time
at which the smaller highwater shall take place.

But if, instead of ss· 4 hours 3ηά ss- 16 hourS, for the meridian passages was found in the same mouth ss
6 hours and ὲ,- 18 hours, then it should have been highest water at 20 hours, because this limit number is
nearer to ά,- 18 hours than 3 hours the other limit number is to ss 6 houm, the other transit time at which the
smaller high water shall take place.

From the times of transit in these examples we have seen that the times os highest water jumps from

noon to morning, when the moon is in the quarters, and it must be difficult, with reference to the retrograding
