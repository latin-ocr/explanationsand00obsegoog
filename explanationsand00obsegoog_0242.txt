Upon the supposition that the shot was on the bottom at 2,800 fathoms, we have an upper current
and an under current operating with a swigging, and a powersul swigging force upon the bight of a line more
than three miles long. Ihave no doubt that theline then parted; and that afterwards the line was tailing out

to the current, that is, the loose end of the line was dristing along with the current. Consequently, by its yielding
below, it lessened the soree to take it from the reel above. The line would, therefore, continue to run out

slowly until the slat-k was taken up, or the bight straightened out below, and then it would go out at the rate

of the drift current, and under-tows combined.
Lieutenant Parke'r gives the time which it took the first 300 sathoms to run out 3 after that, he timed the

800, the 1,300 and so on at 500 fathom interva18‚ up to the 2,800 fathom mark, or the eth interval, when

the time began to run wild.

1 can compare Lieutenant Parker's sounding with Lieutenant Taylor’s of the “Albany.” If we had always
the same line, the same weight, and the same conditions os wind and currentS, drift, &c., we might expect the

time and rate of descent to be very nearly the same in all parts of the ocean. But at one sounding the sea
may be perfectly calm without current3 at another time the boat may be drifting from under the line, with the

current, at the rate of a mile or more an hour. It is, therefore, evident, that equal lengths of line would not

run out in equal times on two such occasions.
Bearing this in mind, we can institute the following comparisons with the first 6 times of 500 fathoms

each, marked by Lieutenant Parker, and with corresponding times and lengths' by Lieutenant Wm. Rogers

Taylor of the “ Albany.'’

Lieut. Parker probably was not exact with his time, for he gives it only to the even minute This is one
cause of discrepancy between him and Taylor. His line was waxed-Taylor's was not: this is another 3 and
the two lines were not of the same manufacture. But it will be observed that Parker's times and marks
agree with Taylor’s very well until we reach 2,800 fathoms-then Parker takes too much time, and becomes
· inconsistent with himself. If bottom had not been reached during the interval, the time from 2,300 to
2,800 fathoms would probably have been about 17 instead of 19 minuteS. 1 shall therefore call the ocean
here, after allowing for drift, δια, about 2,600 fathoms or 3 miles deep.
