mne sca commutes. 227

On the 4th of September, there being a light breeze and a smooth sea, I lowered a boat and sent the

sailing master, ΜΓ. Austin, in hor, who makes the following report:

lst Cast. Used two 32 lb. shot; the line parted while lifting them over the side of the boat.

2d Cast. Used the patent sounding shot, doubled the line three fathoms, lowered the shot over by
another line ; it again parted a few fathoms down.

ad Cast. Used one 32 lb. shot3 the line doubled three fathoms3 the current setting S. S. E„ one knot,
caused the shot to take the line faster than ordinat-ily, but by pulling to windward, kept the boat over the shot,
and got an up and down sounding 5070 fathomS, (all the line the reel could hold,) no bottom :

Cast at 10h. 00m. 30s.
First 1000 fathoms 10 15 30
2000 “ 10 32 30
3000 “ 10 54 54
4000 “ 11 20 00
5000 “ 11 58 40 ’
5070 “ 12 10 05

Temperature of the air 7703 water, 7850 3 barometer, 30.09; current, one knot per hour S. S. Ε.

Ν. B.—-In looking over Commendet Barron's report, Ι find this ship was 40 8¹ north, and 2Ο 6¹ west, of
the position where the “ John Adams'' obtained soundings m 5,500 sathoms.

The sounding stom this ship was directly up and down, as the boat was easily kept over the shot by use

os the oars; no allowance need be made for stray line. Latitude observed, 360 16' Ν. Longitude ob·
servcd, 460 52' w‘ W.” ⁹

“ Μῐ Dazan Sin :—1 enclose several reporta, by Lieut. J. P. Parker‚ os “deep-sea soundings,'' made by
him at various times.

The sounding twine was some that was lest here by the “ St. Mary'8,’' and is nearly expended, though
there is still enough sor one or two more experiments. The result os our attempts has not been particu-
larly favorable: there is great difficulty in ascertaining when the shot touches the bottom, after it has taken off
a thousand or more fathoms of line. You will see by one oslhe casts, which required from morning until
night, that over 8000 fathoms were run out. 1 am sorry that we can‘not report more satisfactorily upon
an experiment requiring so great an expenditure of time and patience. Some of the soundingS, however, are
satisfactory, and give results which we have every confidence in.

Mt. Parker, my Flag Lieutenant, has given a good deal os atention to the matter, and issond of oeeuva‘
tion: of this kind.'’
