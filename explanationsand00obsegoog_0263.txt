Upwards of 40,000 sheets of these charts have been distributed, and the demands for them are daily in—

creasing.

The Ther-mal Charta.

Letter D. of the serieS, designates the thermal charts: 'they show the temperature of the sursaoe water of

the ocean, wherever and whenever it has been observed. These temperatures are characterized by colors and
symbols in such a manner that by a mere inspection of the chartS, the temperatures for any one month may be
recognized and distinguished from the rest. The scale is Fahrenheit3 and the temperatures are put down
just as, they are given in each Log·book, without any attempt to correct for error osthermometer. The thermal
chart of the North Atlantic, compiled by Lieutenant Gantt, in eight large sheets, is published. That of the
South Atlantic, constructed by Lieutenant Gardner, upon the same scale, will be out in a few dayS.

The isothermal lines sor 800, 700 and so on, for every 10Ο os ocean temperatum, have been drawn sor
each mouth upon these charts by Professor Flye.

They afford to the navigator and tho philosopher, much valuable and interesting information touching the
circulation of the oceanic waterS‚ including the phenomena of the cold and warm currents; they also cast light
upon the subject of the hyetographic and climatic peculiarities of various regions os the earth ; they show that the
profile os the coast line of inter-tropical America assists to give expression to the mild climate ofSouthern Europe,
they increase to a marked extent our stock of knowledge concerning the Gulf Stream—that great phenomena
of the ocean 3—for they show that the warm waters of this stream, as it pursues its course to Europe, have a
vibratory motion, so to speak, across its course, like a pendulum slowly propelled by beat on one side, and
repelled by cold on the other: It vibi-ates to aud sro with the season, preserving in the mean time a peculial·
system os convolutions that calls to mind the graceful wavings of a pennen as it floats gently to the breeze.
Indeed, if we imagine the head of the Gulf Stream to be hemmed in by the land in the Straits os Remini, and
to be stationary there, and then liken the tait of the stream itself to an immense pennon fioating gently in a
current: such a motion as such a streamer may be imagined to have, very much such a motion do these charta
show the tail os the Gulf Stream to have.

These charts were prepared sor the press in four sets,—each set shewing the temperatures for one season3
—but they are published with the temperatures os all four seasons on the same sheet. 1 have, owing to the
numerous official demands upon my time, not yet had an opportunity to study them except in sets sor one season
at a time,—therefore 1 cannot give as complete an account of all the facts which they develope, as 1 shall be able to
do when 1 shall have time and opportunity to give them the close study which their importance claims at my hands.

In 1844 1 read before the National Institute, a paper “ on the Gulf Stream and currents os the sea.’' Up
to that time but little was known of this “ river in the ocean,’' except that it exista and conveys an immense
body of warm water from the Gulf of Mexico through the Straits of Florida into the Atlantic Ocean, thence

along the coast os the 3[gnited States towards the shores of Europe by the way of the Grand Banks. Beyond
