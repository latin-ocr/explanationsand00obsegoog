of classifying it, and arranging it side by side with the experience of all the rest, and of presenting the com·
bined results in such a manner as to be obvious at a glauce and available to all, appeared a Herculean task,
which no one before had offered to undertake. Therefore since these charts are but a compilation of what has
fallen under the observation of otherS, and therefore of what was already known to some person or another, it,
in one sense, may be said that they have discovered nothing. Be that as it may, it is certain that they have
brought to light before the public and made available to navigators generally, factS, circumstanceS, and con-
ditions which before were known only to a few.

In 1842, the first official move was made with regard to the subject. [11 that year, I called it to the notice
of the late Commodore Wm. M. Graue, the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, himself an

officer of the most exalted worth. “ He at ouce appreciated the importance of the undertaking, and entered, as
he always did with regard to everything that was useful in his profession, or beneficial to the great interests

, of navigation, most heartily into the spirit of it.

The following circular letter was accordingly issued by him:
