well to have a good line or hawser ready in case it might be needed. In all cases the state of the passage
with regard to the current and sea must be considered before attempting to enter, but this can be observed as
you approach, the current sets down inside the reef from the southward towards the island Motuuta, and the
⁸. reefs on the larboard hand entering. From the Eastern side of the outer reef, the current strikes to the S. W.
pressing down to the lee bar of the Western side and along the reef3 it is necessary when there is any cur·-
rent to keep close to the Eastern reef, to avoid the bar3 in fine weather it is deceiving, as the passage appears
wide, but in heavy weather, the sea breaks on it, leaving in many places, only from 1} to 2 fathoms water.—
Close to the Eastern reef, there is a small sunken shoal in the mouth of the passage, but as there are three
sathoms water 011 it, it is only to be feared by large ships. In the months of January, February and March,
the passage of Papeete is in general bad with a high sea and strong current, during which time vessels have
to enter by the 'I'aunoa passage. Vessels wanting a pilot will do well to wait off Taunoa passage, as he can

then bring them in by either os the passages aa bis judgment may dictate to him. Moreover, as the current
generally sets to the southward between Tahiti and Moorea, ships getting to leeward‚ may have some difficulty

For ships going between Tahiti and Moorea, bound to 'Paravao, Taiarapu, etc., a northerly wind is a fair

by the breeze as long as possible, passing three or four miles from the S. Ε. point of Moorea, and then gradu·

breezes. After having passed Maraa, and working up to the windward for Taravao, it will be well to keep

Ships leaving Papeete, bound to the Southward sor Valparaiso, δια, should, in almost every case, go to

of Moorea with Maraa point, then steer West till the North 8ηά of Moorea ts open with Mal-aa, changing the
course to W. N. W. which will enable you to pass the reef off Maraa two or three miles distant. When the
