Danwm the poet, suggested in the last century, the idea that the salt of the sea is washed into it by the

rains and rivers from the land.
‘⁶ Gnomea! you then taught transuding dews to pass

‘Through time fall’n woods‚ and root-inwove moras·
⁸ Aga after age3 and with filtration fine

⁸ Dispart, from earths and sulphura and saline.

⁸ Hence with diffusive salt old ocean steeps

⁸ His emerald shallow, and his sapphire ticeps,
⁶ oft in wild lakes around their brim
⁴ In hollow pyramids, the crystals swim.”⁸

The waters of Lake Titicaca, which receives the drainage of the great inland basin of the Anda, are
only brachish, not salt.† Hence we may inser that this lake has not been standing long enough to become
brine like the waters of the Dead sea; consequenssy if belongs to a more recent period. On the other hand it
will also be interesting to hear that my friend Captain Lynch informs me, that in his exploration of the Dead sea,
he saw what he took to be the dry bed of a river that once flowed from it. And thus we bave two more links

stout and strong, to add to the circumstantial evidence going to sustain the testimony of this strange and fickle
witness which 1 have called up from the sea to testify in this presence concerning the works of nature, and to
tell us which be the older, the Andes watching the stars with their hoary heads, or the Dead sea sleeping upon
its ancient beds of crystal sait.

On the Saltum qs tlte Sea.

In order to comprehend aright the currents of the sea, and to study with advantage the system os oceanic
circulation, it is necessary to understand the effects produced by the salts of the sea upon the equilibrium of
its waters3 for wherever equilibriurn be destroyed, whether in the air or water, it is restored by motion; and
motion among fluid particles gives rise to currents, which in turn, constitute circulation. The question is

often asked, ‘⁶ why is the sea salt ?’' 1 think it can be shown that the circulation of the ocean dependS, in a great

measure, upon the salts of sea water.

As a general rule, the sea is nearly os a uniform degree of saltness, and the constituents of sea water are as

constant in their proper-ties and as uniform in their proportions, as are the components os the atmosphere.
