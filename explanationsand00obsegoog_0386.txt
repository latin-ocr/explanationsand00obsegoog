380 THE wmn Arm cuntur CHARTB.

As to this candid statement and fair exhibit of the Log, no comments are required to exempt Captain
Goodrich from all blame in the matter 3 noris any remark necessary to show that the length of the passage is
in any way ascribable to the new route. Routes had nothing to do with the conduct of passengers, who in-
terfered with the navigation of the ship in the most unjustifiable manner.

I may here remark, before dismissing the subject of complaints against the Wind and Current ChartS, that

1 have heard that complaints have been made on the part of other vessels also. But in every instance, except

the two quoted, the masters of the complaining vessels have taken care to conceal their journalS. They have
not, as they were under the pledge of word os honor bound to do, furnished me with an Abstract Log of their
voyage. With the evidence before one, that that affordS, the impartial navigator would be at no loss to decide
whether the fault of the passage be owing to the new route or to bad navigation. ι

Those navigators were supplied with the cbarts on condition that they would keep and furnish me regularly
withAbstracts of their Logs. They signed a receipt for the charts containing such a condition. And whether
they make long or short passageS, I am equally entitled to the fulfilment of their engagement. The Abstract
of a long voyage is more valuable than that of a short one, because the former has more observationS, and may

lead to the discovery os faults in the chartS.

To the honor of American ship-masters be it said, that those who fail to keep Abstracts according to
promise are very few. The great majority of them are co-operating with me in this great work, with a zeal‚
ability, and effect the most creditable. And to such ‘1 cannot too often, or too sincerely express my grateful
acknowlcdgments. 1 am proud of their assistance. Their-aid encourages me.

Returning to the‘study of the monthly passages by the two routeS, and to the examination of the chartS.
it will be perceived that the most pertinent question sor the navigator to make with regard to the route hence to
the southern hemisphere, is not “ where shall 1 cross the equator ?'' but “ where shall 1 lose the N. E„ and
where get the S. Ε. trades ?’'

Hence, it will be observed that by following these Sailing Directions vessels will occasionally be compelled
to go as far East as longitude 250 W. ; but this is North os the equator‚ and in those regions and months
where the N. Ε. trades usually fail.

I have given. with all the mistakeS, the passages of 89 vessels that have attempted the new route, and of
73, also taken at random‚ that have gone by the old route. As the result shows, that the routes which I have
proposed, and which were followed by these 89 vessels—many of them doubtingly—has reduced the average
sailing distance from the ports os the United States to the equator‚ as much as two weeks for some months 3
10 days as the average sor the winter and spring, and one week as the average the year round. ’

'l’he average passage to the Line the year round is, by the old route, 41 dayS, by the new, 34.Φ Thus

exhibiting a saving of about 17 per cent. of the usual time under canvass hence to the equator3 which saving

 

⁸This was written and'published three years ago. Since that time navigatore bave learned to follow the new route better. Twenty

days ie now not an uncomrnon passage from N ew Yorlt to the line, and some of the new ships talk os making it in 16. One, the “Flying
Finh,” has made itin 18,—·ee her Abstraet Log-
