it is S. W. The current is similar, sor it seems more like a Gulf stream than a common current following the
direction of the wind.

No navigator should be afraid to approach the coast. Soundings are found far out, the water is much
discolored, as the land is neared3 and we have another sign which seldorn sails in the ‹lay-time, i e. the small
gulls which will always be foundzin forty or fifty miles of the coast, making their presence known by the noise
they make as soon as a vessel is perceived. This seldom sails to be the case.

The navigator should ⁸not be backward in tacking as soon as he finds himself getting off shore, for the
wind will often lead him along sor two or three points, and then favor him for a short distance again, by which
means vessels often get so far to the eastward as to lose much time. I would always recommend a ship to tack
in shore, even if she could make no better than a W. N. W. course, in preference to going to the eastward;
for by keeping well in, she will have smooth water, clear⁴ weather, and wind more off shore. While on the
other hand, when she nears the Falklands, she would begin to have sogS‚ rain, and sleet, and South of the
islands the rain becomes hail-stones and snow. A short distance in these latitudes makes a great difference in
wind, weather, and tides.

For comparison, take Santa Cruz harbor, on the coast of Patagonia, latitude 500 8( S., longitude 680 21'
W., tide in spring forty-eight feet. The Jasan Island, belonging to the Falklands‚ latitude 510 S., longitude
61⁰ 201 W., tide but six feet: here is a great difference in '70 of longitude, about 260 true miles. This will
show the extraordinary difference made in tides by a short distance, and the weather in proportion to the
tides: on the onc it is seldom known to rain, at the other it rains hals the time. At the Straits os Magellan
in a similar way: it seldom rains at the eastern entrance, and at the western it seldom stops; but this is
owing more to the mountains leading from Cape Forward along the straits and srom thence to Cape Tres
Montes or Chile.

Hereabouts we have but little thunder and lightning, but one may be on a hill above the rain, while ‘those
below have a heavy· storm3 1 have seen this occur on Staten Land, also on J uan Fernandez and Massafuera.

Temperature in high southern latitudes differs greatly from temperatura in northern ; in southern latitudes

there seems to be no extremes of beat 3ηά cold as at the North.

Newport‚ for instance, latitude 410 Ν., Long. 710 W., and Rio Negr0, Lat. 410 S., Long. 630 W., as 3

comparison.
In the former the cattle have to be salted and fed during the winter, not being able to get along in the
fields on account of snow and ice.

In the latter, the cattle seed in the fields all the winter, there being plenty of vegetation, 3ηά no use sor hay.
On the Falkland IslandS, thousands of bullockS, she‘ep a'nd horses are running wild in the country, getting
a living all through the winter. This could not be in similar northern latitudes.

On the other hand in the latitude of 500 to 510 N., rye, barley, wheat, δια, can be raised during the sum·

mer, but in South latitude there is not sufficient heat in the summer to bring such things to maturity‚ for even ,

in the depth of summer, you would be liable to snow squaIIS. After-passing the latitude of 400 S., the sum·

mer is not so warm, and the winter not so cold as in northern latitudes
