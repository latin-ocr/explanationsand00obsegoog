ι “ S1n: The first favorable opportunity for measuring the depth of the Southern ocean, with the sounding

. twine received from the Sloop of War St. “Mary’s’' occurred this morning. The weatherbeing calm and sea smooth

1 got up the reel, and in obedience to your instructions tried my first cast. One eighteen pound shot was used,

as I feared the twine would not sustain a heavier sinker. After running out one thousand fathomS, the reel
turning slowly, I attached a second shot of 12 pounds to the line by a messenger, and as the drift was becoming
large, I fitted the sounding nipper. A light air springing up soon increased the drift to nearly a mile, and
aster veering three thousand fathoms the line suddenly slackened as if it had parted. Upon rousing in upon it,
however, it was evident that the shot were suu attached, and more force being applied the line parted near the
nipper. About two thousand and three hundred sathoms of line were lost—which perhaps may indicate
approximately the depth of the sea at this point; as it is nearly certain that we, had found bottom when

f the line slackened. As the reel apparatus was imperfect, I did not think it worth while to note the time of

running out. It was at 9230 A. Μ. when we threw the shot overboard.”

‘⁴ Sm: 1 have the honor to report, that our proximity to the land made the soundings taken at 10 A. M.

not otherwise interesting than as showing the submarine delineation of the coast. After running out about 120
fathomS, the shot (one 32 pounder) suddenly brought up. I estimate the true vertical depth at 90 sathoms.

The line parted near the surface.”

Lat. 300 28¹ S„ [ιονιξ. 450 41' W. Temp. air 660, Water 680, Bar. 30.05.

‘⁴ Srn: Ι have the honor to report the result of “deep sea soundings,” taken at noon this day.

It being perfectly calm, and the ship having no perceptible drift, a fair up and down measurement was
obtained with the sounding twine and two 32 lb. shot. Bottom was struck at one thousand seven hundred
and eighty fathoms (1‚780 fathomS.)

Upon attempting to haul in, the line parted at about two hundred sathoms from the reel ; the line used,
however, is of better quality than any heretofore tried. The moment of the shot striking was noticed, and the
line was almost perfectly plumb, so that this is one of the most reliable soundings which have yet been obtain·

ed from this ship.'’
