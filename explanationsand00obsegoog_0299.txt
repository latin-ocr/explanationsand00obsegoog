he is playing3 but if the first one attacked happens to be a male, nine times in ten the shoal will run off with
such rapidity as soon to be out of sight. The cows are found in shoals from 25 to a hundred in number, not
only at their usual haunts while feeding, but also in their migratory movements in search of food, accompanied
generally by one large bull, who seems to reign over all as king, whose head is always found covered with
scars and woundS, the result, as we always thought, of 11311133 fought with other bulls in defending his gallantry
for the other sex. The principle article of food (and indeed the only one as far as Ι know) is squid; the
smaller kind they eat 13 found near the surface, 3ηά is from two to three feet in length; the larger kind, which
probably have their haunts deep in the sea, must be of immense size—-the flesh soft and ofgelatinous substance.
1 have seen very large junks floating on the surface entirely shapeless. The cows on an average will yield
fifteen barrels of oil; the 1113133, (31· huus, as whalers call them‚) are much larger‚ will yield from fifty to one

hundred barrels os oil. Atthis stage, he is a noble animal, moving through the water so graceful‚ and with

such majesty, and with such astounding velocity; and that too, without apparent muscular action, is sublime;
and when attacked, such perfect command over his locomotion as to entirely change his position as quick as
thought. I have seen theam lay ‘motionless fifty feet off, and in an instant swing their huge flukes under 113,
and at one blow send the boats in splinterS, men and all, ten feet in the air.

Large whales are seldom seen in groups; frequently four or five are found within as many miles of each
other, but more frequently alone. In their several stages of growth, the males will be found in shoals all very

nearly osa size 3 some shoals will yield 20, some 30, some 40, 3ηά sometimes 50 barreIS, each whale. The

males when very young, frequently accompany the other sex, as boys and girls go to school together, and as
they approach a more mature stage, they separate.

I have never been able to approach any satisfactory result in relation to the time a sperm whale live83 the
general opinion is that 'they live forty or fifty years. 1 once extracted the barbed end or head of a harpoon
from the ba'ck of a large whale, enclosed nicely in the oily blubber‚ and the wound entirely healed where it had
been lodged fourteen years. This was satisfactorily proved after we got home, by the initials of the blaeksmith
who made it on one side, and the initials of the captain on the other. Ι remember 'the whale yielded about
fifty barrels of oil; there was nothing in the appearance of the whale indicating old age. Ι 11333 often noticed
their teeth rotten and decayed down to the jaw, and others worn down level with the gum by mastication, and
covered with wrinkles and furrows, having a way-worn appearance, evident marks of slow but progressive
deterioration.

The ship Balena, of this port, Capt. E. Gardner, while at anchor at Karakakua bay, in Owhyhee, took a
large sperm whale off the bay, that yielded them one hundred and two barrels of oil, whose teeth were worn
down level with the gum, evidently by masticating his soft food. This noble animal had no other appearances
of extreme age, bnt seemed to have enjoyed full vigor of health and life3 who then can tell the length of life
they reach, ere it terminates by the ordinary process of nature! may it not 33 probably reach a hundred years,

as close at forty?
