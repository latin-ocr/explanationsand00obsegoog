A UMVERSAL SYSTEM OF OBSERVA'rmNS. “ 31

The missionaries who are stationed among the islands and in heathen landS, form also a class capable of

rendering the most valuable assistance in any comprehensive system of meteorological observationS. As a
corps os observers they are not to be excelled—they visit parts os the world which cannot be brought under
the system except through their instrumentality. While teaching savage man the principles of Christianity‚
and spreading around him the blessings of civilization, these devout men bave also rendered most important
services to the cause of science; and it is not doubted that when such a subject as this shall be brought to
their notice, they will gladly lend it co-operation also.

Stich are the classes and the individuals for whose consideration 1 now submit the proposition for a
universal system of meteorological observationS, for concert of action between the navigator at sea and the
observet on shore, and for a general conference in which all the details connected with such a system shall be
discussed and arranged.

As before stated, the subject has been brought officially before the various governments through the regu·
larly appointed channels of communication. They have been invited to assist and co-operate.

It is proposed, therefore, before taking any definite action either as to the further details, or as to the time
and place for holding the conference, to wait for the replies to these communicationS. ln the mean time,
however, I avail myself of this means of bringing the subject to the notice of the meteorologistS, navigatorS‚
and the friends of science generally, with the hope that thereby the cause will be advanced, and that all whose
good will, friendly counciIS, and co·operation are concerned, will take the matter into consideration, and be
prepared to lend their support to a scheme which has for its object nothing but universal good.

To prevent misconception, it is proper to state that the plan proposed is based upon the principle of
voluntary co-operation, and that Ι have no authority to pledge the Government of the United States for any
expense whatever.

All of which is respectfully submitted,

M. F. MAURY,
&wasm-

Brazil, Chili, Peru, New Granada, Sardinia, the King of the Sandwich IslandS, the Holy See, and Den-
mark, with many Scientific -Societies and learned philosopherS, readily responded to the proposition, and

appointed representatives with whom Ι might consult as to details,

But when the original proposition, as amended by the American Government to include the sea also in the
system o( research, went back to the British Government, it was by that Government referred to the President

and Council of the Royal Society for a report.
