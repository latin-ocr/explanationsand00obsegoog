days after it is taken up there. Suppose it to travel with the velocity os the trade windS‚ at the computed
rate of twenty miles the hour 3 it will only take it about twenty days to reach us from the middle of the southern

hemisphere.

We cannot ascend into the upper regions of the atmosphere to see what is going on there 3 but we have
such a train of well established facts derived from observations here below, that reason mounting on them,
boldly soars alost, and bids us confidently to assert knowledge of what is going on there.

When we see and feel, as in the trade wind region we do see and feel day after day, the year around, the
wind blowing as steadily from the poles towards the equator, as the Mississippi runs down to the Gulf, we are
forced to the conclusion that as much air, precisely as much, as we see coming from towards the poleS, and
going towards the equatur, has to go from the equator back towards the poles. Is this were not se, there
would be an exhaustion, and this wonderful engine that we are considering, would break· down, for there
would finally be a vacuum about the poles with a tremendous atmospherical accumulation about the equator.

Recurring to the illustration given just now, and considering both hemisphere8‚ we shall see that the atmosn
phere, like the string of a musical instrument, has its nodes or points of rest. These nodes serve as escape
valves to the winds. In the equatorial calmS, both the N. E. and S. E. trades have run their course on the
surface, they are going up to blow as upper currents, and therefore the motion of the air here in these calma,
could it be seen and measured, would be upwards 3 and for the same reason, when the two upper currente meet
in the region of the TropicS, the motion of the air is downward, for after passing this node, each upper
current becomes a surface wind, and each is going whence the other came?

Important operations are carried on, and purposes grand in the system of terrestria] economy are doubtless

subserved by these atmospheric nodes.

This singular fact has been brought out by the investigatione. which we are conducting at the Observatory,
with regard to the winds ε Our investigations in the Atlantic‚ for we have not carried them much further, show

us that the S. E. trade wind region is much larger than the N. E.—1 speak of its extent over the Atlantic

ocean only.

The S. Ε. trades are the fresher3 they often push themselves up to 10Ο or 150 of North latitude3 whereas
the N. E. trade winds seldom get 'South of the equator.

Seeing that there is so much more room for evaporation in the southern than in the northern hemisphere,
and that there is so much more precipitation on this than on the other side of the equator, we are led to one of
two conjectures: first, that aqueous vapor in its invisible state can permeate the atmosphere3 in other words,
it can flow through the air in separate orindependent currents of its own, like some of the gases. In this case,
we must further conjecture the seat os some power unknown, which would always drive this vapor from the

southern over into the northern hemisphere. We know of no such tendency in vapor, of no such permeability

 

'¹ If this interchange of atmosphere did not take place between the two hemispherea, how woulda proper mixture of the air be
preserved. In the North there is much more land, and many more plant· and animal: to corrupt the air, than in the south, ⁸¹²4 ⁰⁰¹⁸„
the intemhange did take place, there would be a reason to infer a different-,e as ιο atmospherical purity in the two hemispheree.
