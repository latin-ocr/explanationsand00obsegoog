since been with Capt. Middleton in the ship George and Mary of New London to the Ochotsk sea, and says
that the large common whales of Davis’ straits and the Ochotsk sea, out of which the ships usually make the
chief parts of their cargoe8‚ are exactly alike. Other men who have been in the McLellan‚ are probably by
this time in the whaling business in the vicinity of Behring’s straitS, uho will be able to give more particulars
in the course of the ensuing year, when more complete, more certain, and more satisfactory answers may be
obtained.

Capt. Thomas B. Roys made a voyage in the ship Superior of Sag Harbor last year, and procured a full
cargo to the northward of and inside of Behring’s StraitS. He is probably the first American shipmaster that
has entered that sea 3 he told me that whales commonly taken in the vicinity of the straits are generally large,
fat and sluggish3 and he also found there several other kinds of whales of smaller size, one of which kinds
differed from any he had before seen, having a horn on the end of the head, which this species of whale use
for rooting 'up their food from the bottom, and differs from every species os whale he had seen in other places ;
and he also spoke particularly of the whales taken in latitude 500 to 600 North being much more active and
fierce, and more difficolt to approach and more dangerous to take than those in latitude ’70ο in Behring's Straits.
He is now in command of the ship Sheffield‚ chiefly owned by myself and brothers, which vessel left here the
18th August for San Francisco and the Sandwich Islands where he-is to complete his outfits for another
whaling voyage, during which Capt. Roys intends again to go through and to the north of Behring's StraitS.
1 am also interested in the bark Alice, Captain A. D. Smith, which vessel sailed the first of this week3 and in
the ship Huntsville‚ Captain Freeman Smith, to sail in the course of the next month. It is expected that these
Captains will all pass Behring’s Straits early in the spring, and either of them will be willing to comply with
any requests you may have to make. 1 can hand to Capt. Freeman Smith any communication you may wish
to make to him, and I can send to Capt. Roys by the overland route via Panama to San Francisco any commu·
nication you may wi'sh him to have3 both of which I will forward with great pleasure. I make this offer, sup-
posing you may have suggestions to make in addition to the one of bringing the skull bones of one of the
whales os the West Coast.

Capt. Roys thinks there is land or very shoal water to the North os Bebring's straitS, as he found the sound-
ings diminished as he sailed 'North; he also found on his entering the straits in the mouth of July an insetting
current apparently dividing, and the strongest part of it running to the Northeast along Georgia, and another
part setting to the Northwest, at a time when it was supposed the melting snows and ice would in the
spring force the water outward3 instead of which on his outer passage in September he experienced a dimin·

ished outward current setting to the South.

Messrs. Perkins and Smith of New London, the chief owners of the McLellan, will probably fit that ·

ship again, in which case 1 have no doubt of their willingness to do anything in the way suggested that you
may wish- Should that ship not gc, the only way to procure a skull would be by asking the master osone of

the English whalemen from a Scotch port to procare one, as they will have that business exclusively if the
Memnon t⁵hould be withdrawn, which Ι hope may nothe the case.”
