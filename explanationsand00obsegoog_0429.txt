to the ‘⁸ mooted point” of making the passage uround this 0‘ bug aboo Cape Horu Ι most istinctiy disagree with those who recommend keeping tn the eastward ofthe F'alkland
lalanda ; not conceiving the necessity of keeping so sur to leeward render g he benting against a heavy head sen and strong current necessary. The chauces for S. Ε. winde do
