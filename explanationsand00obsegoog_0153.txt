Near the graves were also other unmistakable evidences of the missing expedition having passed its first
winter here. They consisted os innumerable scraps of old rope and canvass3 the block on which stood the
armorer’s auvil, with many pieces of coal and iron around it: the outlines of several tentS, or houseS, sup-
posed to have been the sites os the observatory, and erections for sheltering the mechanicS. The chips and
shavings of the carpenter still remained.

A short distance from this was found a large number of preserved meat-tinS, all having the same labels as
“ those found at Point Innes.

Fr9m all these indicationS, the inference could not fail to be arrived at, that the Erebus and Terror had

made this their first winter quarters after leaving England. The spot was admirably chosen sor the security

of the shipS, as well as for their early escape the following season. Everything, too, went to prove that up to
this point the expedition was well organized, and that the vessels had not received any material injury.

Early in the morning of the 28th August, H. B. M. ship Resolute, Captain Austin, with ber steam ten-
der, arrived from the eastward. Renewed efforts were made by all parties to discover some written no·
tice, which, according to his instructionS, Sir John Franklin ought to have deposited at this place in some
conspicuous position. A cairn os stones erected on the highest part of the island was discovered. A most
thorough search with crows and picks was instituted at and about it, in the presence of all hands. This search
was continued for several dayS, but not the slightest vestige of a record could be found. The graves were
not opened nor disturbed.

Capt. Sir John Ross had towed out from England a small vessel of about 12 tonS. He proposed leaving
her at this point, to sall back upon in case of disaster to any of the searching vessels. Our contribution to
supply her was three barrels of provisionS.

From the most elevated part os Beechy island (about 800 feet high,) an extensive view was had both to
the north and west. No open water could be seen in either direction.

On the 29th os August we cast off from Beechy island and joined our consort at the edge of the fixed
ice, near Point J oneS.

Acting Master S. P. Griffin, commander of the Rescue, had just returned from a searching excursion
along shore, on which he had been despatched 48 hours before. Midshipman Lovell and four men, composed
his party. He reportS, that pursuing carefully his route to the northward, he came upon a partially overturn-

ed cairn os large dimensione, on the beach a few miles south of Cape Bowden. Upon strict examination it

appeared to have been erected as a place of deposite sor provisions, No clue could be found within it or
