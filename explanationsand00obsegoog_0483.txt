Vaitoare harbor about two miles North os the Isthmus, has a fine and safe anchorage. Vessels can enter
or depart from the northward or southward, but the northern passage is the best.

Tematoe——About two miles -to the southward of the point of Hitiaa, there is a good entrance into the reef,
called by this name os Tematoe, vessels can pass inside close to the point of Hitiaa, into good anchorage.

Hitiaa is on ‘the N. E. part of Tahiti, but the harbor is not good, the bottom being very rocky. After en·
tering the rees, haul to the northward, and anchor near a small island. In leaving Hitiaa, vessels can go out
by Mahena, the best anchorage at Mahena is in sho‘re of a small low island, known as Nansouty’s Island.

Point Venus—The bay of Point Venus is exposed to the westerly and northerly windS. The anchorage
is sufficiently safe, excepting in the months of December, January, February and March. In entering the bay,
haul close round the reef on the East side, passing in between the reef and the Dolphin bank—Anchorage un-

der the Point, about two cables' length from the shore.

Papaoa is on the N. W. side, and about three miles to the southward of Point Venus, it has good an-
chorage—there are, however, several sunken sboals inside the passage, which pass outside of, keeping along

the outer bank; the best anchorage is at the head of the bay.
It would not be prudent for ships running to the westward along the North side of Tabiti, more particu-

larly large vesseIS, to approach the land closer than 33 miles, as there are sunken shoals lying off in different
places—These shoals commence at Mahaena, extending to the westward, as sar as a small island that lies a
little to the eastward of Point Venus,

Vessels bound to Papeete, if there should be any southing in the wind, must bear in mind that the breeze
⁸ will not reach the passage3 sometimes only as far as Point Venus; other times it will reach to Taaone, and in
some particular cases close to Papeete, but never as sar as the passage. When you get in shore off Papeete,
there will be an eddy wind from the Soutbward and Westward3 in such cases it will be well to keep off shore
in the line of the sea-breeze. When Papeete passage bears S. E. haul in shore gradually into the calm 01
variable windS, which is always the case between the two winds, In most casea, aster a little time you -will
have a S. W. or Westerly light breeze which will gradually increase as you near the passage, for the closer in
the stronger the eddy wind; you will often find twice the wind inside the rees that there is outside.

At times vessels coming down from the Eastward, after passing Point VenuS, are lest suddenly in calms or

with light variable winds, the sea-breeze hauling off, in that case it is advisable to keep in shore if possible,
making short tacks for the harbor, as the the eddy wind before mentioned, is stronger close in when placed be-
tween the two windS, as a vessel may be becalmed a whole day, with no chance of getting into port; at timeS,
the Easterly wind will carry a vessel to the harbor's mouth; when inside the mind is the contrary way; when
this is the case, you can make bold to stand in, keeping as close to the Southern bar as is prudent, standing
by to brace round the yards as soon as you seel the air. In standing in with a good breeze, if the wind should
leave you in the passage, and it should be calm inside, the way the ship has will carry her either to her anchor-
age or within reach of the bnoy, enabling her to swing clear of all danger. The buoy has been placed for the

purposegpf running a line to haul up to, and ⁸.⁰ prevent the necessity of dropping an anchor. It would be
