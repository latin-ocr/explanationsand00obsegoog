The mutes to and fro, between Europe and the United States, do not require any written explanation. Is
the navigator will project them, and then consult these pages and the Pilot Chart, he will never be at a loss as
to his best course οπ the average. In projecting these tracks on his chart, he will find them running sometimes
inconveniently near the land or over shoals. of course he will not infer that he is recommended actually to stand
over such places. The route of the tables being intended merely as a guide, from which the land as well as
the winds and currents will sometimes turn him aside. Navigators who pursue these routes, will confer a favor
ΒΥ making 3 note of the fact in their abstractS, accompanied with an expression os their opinion as to the
advantages of them, mentioning also whether they have had any longer or shorter passages than vessels sailing
about the same time without the Wind and Current Ch'arts on board.

1 have already the pleasure to acknowledge my obligations to captain Oliver Eldridge‚ os the
“ Roscius,” sor such an act os kindness. Under date of May 21, 1850, he writes: “ In reply to your inquiries

as to my opinion in regard to the New Sailing Directions 3311 Routes recommended ΒΥ yoursels, 1 would say

ἢ that as far as 1 have had opportunity of judging, 1 think they will Β3 of great advantage, and in particular

to that part of the commercial community who depend upon wind as a propelling power.

“ On my last passage to Liverpool, 1 think it was lengthened some two or three days ΒΥ not following
more closely the directions recommended ΒΥ you in your No. sor January, 1850: as a ship that left New
York with us, kept in company, or nearly so, to the longitude os 250. The wind then came out ahead3 we ,

stood on the southern tack, and she on the northern, (as recommended by you.) The wind afterwards came
N. N. E. 3 she brought up to Cape Clear, and we 200 miles south of it.''

 

Explanation qs tlte Route Tables.
Columns 1, 2 3311 3 (333 tables os routes, pp. 328 to 337, also those of the route to Rio,) explain themselves.

Column 4 gives the distance by middle latitude sailing to be run on the course in column 3, when the
winds are fair.

Column 5, shows the per centage by which the distance 13 column 4 is to Β3 practically increased 03 the
average, ΒΥ adverse winds. The numbers in this column are obtained upon this principle: that if a ship 3311
with the wind dead ahead, and within six points of it, she loses 62 miles in every hundred—that is, she has to
3311 100 to make 38 miles good3 when she 33113 within 4 points of her course, that is, when she has a slent
wind that will allow her to lay within 4 points of her ‘cour-se, she loses 29 miles only 13 100; 3311 when she
33113 within two points of her course, that is, when she has a slent wind 4 points from the course she wishes to
steer, she then 10333 only ‘m miles 13 100. 13 other words, a vessel sailing5 knots an hour will get as far 011
her course in δὲ 110313 with a stant wind 4 points from her course, as she will, at the same rate, in 13 hours,
with the wind dead ahead. According to the ratio here indicated, the 2 and 4 point slent winds, have been
reduced to their equivalent as winds dead ahead, and this equivalent 13 distance is given in column 5.

0013133 6 shows the distance in column 4 after the per cent. in column 5 1133 Β333 added to it. Itis the

average distance to be sailed from point to point, not allowing for currents, 3311 supposing the vessel to atil
within 6 points of the wind when close hauled.
