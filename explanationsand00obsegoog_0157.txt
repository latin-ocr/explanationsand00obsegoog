THE oPEN SEA IN THE ARCTIC ocEAN. 151

in the morning the ssoes began to be pressed together with so much force that their edges were thrown up in
immense ridges of rugged hummockS. The Advance was beavily nipped between two floeS, and the ice was
piled up so high above the rail on the starboard side as to threaten to come on board and sink us with its
weight. All hands were occupied in keeping it out. The pressure and commotion did not cease till near
midnight, when we were very glad to have a respite from our labors and fears. The next day we were threat-

ened with a similar scene, but it fortunately ceased in a short time.

For the remainder of September and until the 4th of October, the vessels drifted but little. The winds

were very light3 the thermometer fell to minus 120 and ice formed over the few pools in sight, sufficiently
strong to travel upon. ι

We were now strongly impressed with the belief that the ice had become {ixed for the winter, and that
we should be able to send out travelling parties from this advanced position for the examination of the land
to the northward. Stimulated by this fair prospect, another attempt was made to reach the shore in order to
establish a depot of provisions at, or near Cape Manning, which would materially facilitate the progress of our
parties in the spring, but the ice was still found to be detached from the shore, and a narrow lane of water cut
us off from it.

During this interval of comparative quiet, preliminary measures were taken for heating the Advance‚ and
increasing her quarters so as to accommodate the officers and crews of both vessels, No stoves bad as yet
been used in either vessel; indeed they could not well be put up without placing a large quantity of stores
and fuel upon the ice. The attempt was made to do this, but a sudden crash in the floe where it appeared
strongest, causing the loss of several tons of coal, convinced us that it was not yet safe to do so· It was not
till the 2011] of October that we got fires below. Ten days later the housing-cloth was put over, and the offi-
cers and crew of the Rescue ordered on board the Advance for the winter. Room was found on the decl< of
the Rescue sor many of the provisions removed from the hold of this vessel; still a large quantity had to be
placed on the ice.

The absence of fires below had caused much discomfort to all hands ever since the beginning of Septem-
ber; not so much from the low temperature as from the accumulation of iupisture, by condensation‚ which con·
gealed as the temperature decreased, and covered the wood-work of our apartments with ice. This state of things
soon began to work its effect upon the health of the crews3 several cases of scurvy appeared among them3 and
notwithstanding the indefatigable attention and active treatment resorted to by the medical officerS, it could not
be eradicated 3 its progreSS, however, was checked.

All through October and November we were drifted to and fro by the changing wind, but never passed
out of VVellington Channel. On the first of November the new ice had attained the thickness of thirty-seven
inchesz still, frequent breaks would occur in it, often in fearful proximity to the vessels. HutnmockS, con-
sisting of massive granite-like blockS, would be thrown up to the height oftwenty, and even thirty feet. This

action in the ice was accompanied with a variety of sounds impossible to be described3 but when heard,
never failed to carry a feeling of awe into the stoutest hearts. In the stillness of an arctio night they would

be heard several miles ; and often was the rest of all hands disturbed by them.
