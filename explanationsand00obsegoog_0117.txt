ιι for Doctor Marcet. Dr. Marcet died before receiving it, and it had remained in the captain’s hands some
time before it came into those of Wollaston.

lt may therefore have lost something by evaporation, for it is difficult to conceive that an the river water
and three-fourths of the sea water which runs into the Mediterranean is evaporated fremit, leaving a brine sor the
under current, haning four times as much salt as the water at the surface of the sea usually contains. Vei-y
recendy, M. Coupvent des Bois, bas shown by actual observafion, the existence of an outer and under current
from the Mediterranean. ⁶ κ

These facts, and die statements of the Secretary of the Geograpbical Society of Bombay, seem ho leave
no roem to doubt as to the existence of an under current from the ned sea, and as to the cause of the surface
current which ssows into it. 1 think it a matter ef demonstr-atich.

Nature is a whole, and all the departments thereos are intimately connected. If we attempt to study in
one of them, we find ourselves tracing clues which lead us off insensibly into otherS, and, before we are aware,
we discover ourselves exploring the chambers of some other department.

The study of drift takes the geologist out to sea, and reminds him that a knowledge of πεῖρε, winds and
currents, of navigation and hydrography, are closely and intimately connected with his favorite pursuit.

The astronomer directs his telescope to the most remote star, or to the nearest planet in the sky¹ and
makes an observation upon it. He cannot reduce this observation, nor make any use of it, until he has
availed himself of certain principles of optics3 until he has consulted the thermometer‚ gaug-ed the atmosphere,
and considered the effect of beat in changing its powers of refraction. In order to adjust the pendulum of his
clock to the right length, he has to measure the water of the sea and weigh the Earth z he too must therefore
go into the study of the tides; he must examine the Earth’s crust, and consider the matter of which it is
composed from pole to pole, circumference to centre 3 and in doing this, he finds himself in his researches
right alongside of the navigator, the geologist and the meteorologist, with a host of other good fellowS, each
one holding by the same thread, and following it up into the same labyrinth-all, it may be, with different objects
:in view, but nevertheless, where there are stores of knowledge for an, and instruction sor each one in particular.
And thus, in undertaking to follow the “ wind in his circuits'’ over the ocean, I have found myself standing
side by side with the geologist on the land, and with him far away from the sea shore, engaged in considering
some of the phenomena which the inland basius of the Barth—those immense indentations on its surface that
have no sea drainage—present for contemplation and study.

Among the most interesting of these, is that of the Dead sea. Lieutenant Lm cn, U. S. Navy‚ has run

a level from that sea to the Mediterranean, and finds the former to be about 13,001 feet below the general sea

level of the Earth. In secking to account for this great difference of water level, the geologist examines the
