By examining this abstract it will be seen that the “ Flying Cloud” sailed from New york, June the 26,
18513 went the new route3 crossed the Line in the Atlantia, June 24-5, in Long. 3303 and cleared Cape

St. Roque thence in two dayS.
She passed inside of the Falkland Islands J uly the 20th‚ and on the aith was around the cape3 having

in the meanwhile, rode out a furious gale that lasted two days.

In Lat. 370 S.,July 31st, she took the wind from the southward and eastward‚ and so carried it to Lat.
120 N. in 1270 W.—having crossed the Line in the Pacific, August 12th, in 1240 W.

She was a day in the “ doldrumS,” between these two systems of trade windS. Finally she took the N.
E. trades about the parallel of 140 N. in 1270 W. They held on to the North of N. E„ having forced her on
the 24th as far as 1420, on the parallel of 350 N .; from which point, aster fighting for 5 days with the wind
from the northward and eastward—right in her teeth—-she had two days of N. W. winds which she got as she
neared the shore, and so ran in to the harbor of San Francisco at dayligbt of Sept. lst.

For 26 days, consecutively, this ship averaged‚ according to her Abstract Log‚ two hundred and twenty-
' seven two-fifth nautical miles 3 day 3 her least performance for any one os these days being 93 mileS, and her
greatest mam: nuunnan aun snvnnrv-F0033 374 nautical miles are equal to 4332 English or statute miles3
which gives the extraordinary seat of a vessel, under canvaSS, having averaged for 24 consecutive hours the
enormous rate of 151⁷, knots, or eigkteen statute miles, per honr. ⁶

As an illustration of the extent, as to which these charts are benefitting navigatore who use them and
who are assisting in perfecting them, 1 interline the proof sheet with a letter just received from Captain
J. W. Lawrence, of the American ship “ Blanchard,'’ dated San Francisco‚ January 7, 1853.

“ Sia: Doubtless you will observe from the above abstract, that we have a very poor chance to make a

quick passage with a ship of 600 tons, drawing 19 feet of water.
In regard to the passages of other ships to the line, 1 have met with but two ships that left about the

same time that 1 did z the St. Peter from New York, 63 days to the equator3 she did not have your charts on

board3 the other ship 60 days to the line. In] respect to your sailing directione, Ι consider this abstract but

a small compensation for the information derived srom them·.'’

 

The influence of the arid plains in the interior of North America upon the-N. E. trades of the Pacific,
(of which I have so osten spoken) compared with the influence of the land in South America, upon the

S. E. trades off its western coast, is most strikingly illustrated by the table, (p. 437.)

The distance from Valparaiso to the usual places of crossing the line in the Pacific is greater than the
distance from such places to California. Yet of the 26 vessels in the table, (p. 437,) that have gone from val·
paraiso to California, (and which crossed the line between 960 W. and 1200 W.,) the average to the line is 22 days»,
and their average thence to Californiais 353 days. The two shortest trips from Valparaiso to the line being 14

days by the “ Vernon,'’ which crossed in 11903 and 15 days by the “ Angelique‚'' which crossed in 990 W.
