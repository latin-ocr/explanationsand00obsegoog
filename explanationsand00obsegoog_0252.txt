Now it is plain, that is there are two tide waves placed upon each other, whereof‚ the one is 12 hours

above ‘and 12 hours below a horizontal plane, and the other alternatively only 6 hours up, and 6 hours down
that level; isone os the 6 hours floodS, falls upon a part os the 12 hours diurnal flood, the other 6 hours flood

belonging to the same Lunar'tide wave, must fall upon the 12 hours diurnal low water, and hence the differ·

 

.................... dim-nal wave.

.- ------- lunar wave-

observed tide-wave.

From a to b, is the 12 hours part above the horizontal plane3 and b c, the 12 hours part of the diurna}
vave below this plane3 d e, the 6 hours part above the diurnal wave ; e s, the 6 hours below the diurnal wave·,
fg, the 6 hours above the diurnal wave, and g e, the 6 hours below the diurna} wan, forming altogether the
observed or absolute tidal wave, a, d, e, s, g.

From the figure it will be easily understood that the highest possible absolute highwater only can take place
when the highest water of the diurnal wave and the highest water of the lunar tide happen to fall in the same
place, and this can only take place when the sun’s declination is greatest ; then the diurnal wave is greatest also.
For every other time it is only required to know which of the two lunar tides sall upon a portion os that part

of the diurnal wave that is above the horizontal plane3 and is the time of the highest water osa certain day
be required, we consequently know that it must be sought between the limits in time in which the diurnal wave

is above the horizontal plane3 and further, if those limits be fixed, the highest water will always take place be·

tween those fixed limita. But those limits are not fixed3 according to one year’s observatione, they have a
monthly retrograding motion, and this is the reason that every month has its own limits.

Ι have given this explanation, because you know that in our time navigators wish to have the rules ex·
plained to them. It is a very fortunate occurrence in navigation that the believers open the way sor investiga·

tora.
