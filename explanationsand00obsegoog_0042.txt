At the time that this amendment was offered, it was not known here that the Government os Great Britain

had invited the co-operation of other Governments generally in the 9133 which she had proposed sor the
“ nineteen stations'' of her Royal EngineerS.

Moreover, as the proposition to establish a uniform plan os making and recording meteorological
observations on shore, seems to meet with more or less opposition among meteorologistS, 1 would recommend
that the United States should afford, as far as practicable, the co·operation asked for by Great Britain in the
first place3 abandon, for the present at least, that part of the ‘⁴ universal system’' which relates to the Laud, and
direct our efforts mainly to the Sea, where there is such a rich harvest to be gathered for 'commerce and navi-
gation, as well as for the increase os knowledge, the advancement of science, and the benefit of man.

I arn further induced to make this recommendation in consequence os the.evident reluctance with which
Russia, Austria, Bavaria, Belgium and other powerS, seem to regard any change in their system of meteorologi-
cal observations on shore, and under which some of their savam, as Dove, Kriel, Lamont, Quetelet, et aL,

have obtained a world-wide reputation.
On the Land, the field is already well filled with laborers: it has been occupied for a Iong time, and each

’ country seems to have adopted a system of its own, according to which its laborers have been accustomed to

work, and to which its meteorologists are more or less partial.

Any proposition having in view, sor these system, a change so radica} as to bring them to uniformity, and

reduce them to one for all the world, would, I have reason to believe, be regarded with more or less jealousy
by many3 and though there be not a few societies and individuals of great eminence and worth, such as the
Academy of Sciences of France, the Meteorological Society os Great Britain, and the Royal Danish Society
of Sciences, that have manifested a readiness to entertain propositione to sueh an effect: yet Meteorology is a
science, which depends so much for progress, upon harmony, co-operation and mutual accord of observet-s,
that 1 have deerned it expedient not to press observers on the land for any co-operation with obser vers at sea,
except such as they will willingly give in their own way, and according to their own 9133,

Independent os these considerationS, there is another, which should be paramount in inducing us not to
press the proposition for a universal system of Meteorological Observations on the land, and a general co-oper·
ation of Meteorologists therein: “

The British Government„ which had taken the lead in that feature of the plan, upon the receipt of the
American proposition to include the sea also, and make the plan universal, referred the subject to the Presia·
dent and Council of the Royal Society for a report-

That Society, at its sitting of the 29th of April last, adopted a report upon the subject which had· been
brought before it by command of the Earl os Malmesbury, in which “ with reference to the proposal for ·
the establishment os a universal plan, in respect to instruments and modes of observations„ on the land, the
opinion is expressed, that no “ practical advantage is likely to be obtained by pressing such a proposition, in-
the present state of Meteorological Science.’'

Bowing to the authority and weight of this opinion—respect for the source whence it emanateS, and a
