The distance from it to Port Philip is about 6‚700 rniles,the arc of the great circle crossing the prime meridiari

between the parallels of ’700 and 750 8., the meridiari of 550 east between the parallels of 800 and 820 S.
Here it reaches its greatest southern declination, and begins then to incline northwardly.

Australia bound vesseIS, therefore, are advised, after crossing the equator near the meridiari of 300 W.—
say between 250 and 320, as the case may be—to run down through the S. E. tradeS, with topmast·studding·
sails set, if they have sea room, aiming to cross 300 south, generally somewhere about 280 or 300 W., and
so on, shaping their course aster they get the winds steadily from the westward, more and more to the
eastward, until they cross the prime meridian to the south of 500, reaching 550 south in about 200‘east.
Thence the best course—if ice, δια, will allow—is onward still to the southward of east, not caring to
get to the northward again of 550 before reaching 1200 Ε. The highest latitude should be reached between
the meridians of 600 and 800 east. The course then is north of east, gradually hauling up more and more to
the north as you approach Van Dieman’s Land.

Such is the best route to Australia.-The highest degree of south latitude (and as a rule the farther you
go south, the shorter the distance) which it may be prudent to touch, depending somewhat on the season of the
year and the windS. If the winds are not good and strong, bear south to look for them. ln our summer, one
will not have to go so far south to look for these winds, as he will in our winter. The shortest passages
therefore will probably be made in the southern summer when daylight, the winds, ice and state of the weather
are most favorable for reaching high southern‘ latitudes.

Now the first thing that will probably strike the navigator who has not been accustomed to measure on a

terrestrial globe the distance between places, will be ‘the fact that the Cape of Good Hope, instead of being

a sort of half way station on the road side between Europe or the United States and New Holland, is some
thousand miles or more to the northward of the shortest and best route.

And the next thing will be, that the best crossing on the Equator for Australian bound vessels from the
United States is not to the eastward, but it is on the same meridien which affor-ds the best crossing for the
Rio or Cape Horn bound vessels.

Vessels therefore bound to Australia from the United States should take the Rio route as far as the Equa-
tor. Vessels thither bound from Europe, should aim to cross the Equator in about 250. Farther east would
take them where the Equatorial doldrums will prove' troublesome ; farther west, too far out os the way.

Having crossed the Equator with sea room and a¹ good offing from the shores os Brazil, the best course
for all, 'whether European or American, is, as before stated, to crack on through the S.E. Trades with topmast
studding sails set, or at any rate with a clean rap-full.

When these winds fail, as they will do, from 250 S. in our summer and sall, to 350 or even 400 in our
Winter and Spring, and the Australian trader finds himself in the “ Horse Latitudes” of the southern hemis·
phere, his course is then due Soutlr until he gets beyond them and well into the strong westerly winds of that
region.

These winds will be found between the parallels of 450 and 550 generally, but always between 500 and
