which the winds that cross the equator at the several places named, are as sharply defined in nature as the

lines suggested, or as Plate IV would represent them to do.
' The whole region ot? the extra-tropical old world, that is included within the ranges marked, is the 'region

which has most land to windward of it in the south'ern hemisphere. No 3 11 18 3 311110383οἰησίἅ3333 31 least,

as they are, by‘ desig-n ; and in being so placed3'it was intended ,that they shouldsub‘serve some gra'nd purpose

in the terrestrial economy. Let us see, therefore, if we· 333 discover a'ny marks of» that designL-any of tho

purposes of su'ch 33 arrangement—and trace any connection b'etwe'en that arrangement 3ηά the suppositior‘r

which 1 maintain, as to the place* where the winds that blow over those regions derive their vaporS.

It will be remarked at once that all the inland scas of Asia‚' 3ηά 311 111083 of- Europe, eircept the semlss
freshwater gulfs of the North, are within this range. The Persian Gulf and the‘Re‘d 833, 1113 Mediterranean»,
the Black and the Caspian, all fall within it. And why are they planted there? Why are they arranged to
the northeast and southwest under this lec, 3ηά 13 1113 very direction in which theory makes this breadth of
thirsty winds to 11133311.Ρ Clearly 3ηά obviously, one of the purposes iri the Divine economy 3338, 11131 they
might replenish with vapor the winds which are almost vaporle'ss when they -arrive at these ·regions in the

general system of circulation. And why should these winds be almost veporless ?’ They are alm'ost vaporless,

because their route in the general system of circulation is such, that-th'ey are not brought into contac‘t with's Α

water sursace from which the needsul-supplies of vapor are to be hadr or being obtained, the supplies ha've ,

81333 been taken away by the cool tops of mountain tanges over-which th'ese winds have had 10 pa'sS.

In 1113 Mediterranean, the evaporation is greater than 1113 precipitation. · Upo‘n 'the Red Sea there 33331·
falls a drop of rain3 it is all evaporation. Are we not therefore entitled to regard the ¹R³ed⁴ sea as a makek
weight thrown in to regulate the proportion of cloud and sunshine,·and to dispense rain to certain ›parts-of the
Barth 111 due season and in proper quantities? Have we not, in these 'two 111318, evidence conclusive, that the
winds which blow over these two 8338, come, sor the most part, from ’ 3 dry country, froin regions which con·
taiu few or 30 pools to furnish supplies of vapor?

Indead, so scantily supplied with vapor are the winds which· pass 13 1113 general 311333318 of · circulation

deposit. But throwing out os the question what is taken up from the surface of the Mediterranean itself‚‘these

winds depositmore water 03 1113 water-shed whose drainage leads intothat sea, than they take up from it· again.

The‘excess is to be found in the rivers which discharge into.the Mediterranean 3 but so thirsty are the winds

which blow across the bosom of that sea, that they not only take‘up again all 1113 water that thoses rivers pour

into it, but they are supposed by philosophers to create a demand for an immense current from the Atlantic to

supply the waste.
