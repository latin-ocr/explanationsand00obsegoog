proper regard for the circumstances under which it was called forth, seem to render any further action, with
regard to the land feature of the plan, highly inexpedient, not to say indelicate, 3ηά therefore improper, on our
part. ⁸

Not sc, however, with regard to the sea3 that meets with decided favor and earnest support.

In the report already alluded tc, the President and Council of the Royal Society hold the following
language with reference to the suggestions made by the scientific men of the United States: “The proposition
of Lieut. Maury to give a greater extension and a more systematic direction to the meteorological observatione
to be made at sea, appears to be deserving of the most sen'ous attention of the Board of Admiralty. In order
to understand the importance of this proposition, it will be proper to refer to the systems of observations which
have been adopted of late years in the Navy and Merebant service of the United StateS, and to some few of
the results to which it has already led. Instructions are given to Naval captains and masters of ships, to note

in their logs the points of the compass from which the wind blows, at least once every eight hours ; to record

, the temperature of the air, and of the water at the surface, and when practicable, at considerable depths of the

sea3 to notice all remarkable phenomena which may serve to characterize particular regions of the ocean,
more especially the direction, the velocity, the depth and the limits of the currentS. Special instructions also
are given to whalers to note down the regions where whales are found, 3ηά the limits of the range of their
different species. A scheme for taking these observations regularly and systematically, was submitted by
Lieut. Maury to the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, in 1842 and instantly adopted. De·
tailed instructions were given to every American ship-master, upon his clearing from the Gustum-house, ac-
companied by a requflst that they would transmit to the proper office, after their return from their voyage, copies
of their logs, so far at least, as they related to these observations, with a view to their being exannined, dis-
cussed, and embodied in charts of the winds and currents, and in the compilation of sailing directions to every
part os the globe. For some years the instructions thus furnished received very little attention, and very few
observations were made or communicated ; the publication, however, in 1848, of some charts, founded upon
the discussion of the scanty materials which had come to hand, or which could be collected from other sources,
and which indicated much shorter routes than had hitherto been followed to Rio, and other parts of South
Amerina, was sufficient to satisfy some of the intelligent ship-masters of the object and real importance of the
scheme, and in less than two years from that time it had received the cordial co·operation of the masters of
nearly every ship that sailed. At the present time, there are nearly 1000 masters of ships engaged in making
these observations; they receive freely in return the charts of the winds and currents, and the sailing directions
which are framed upon them, corrected up to the latest period.

“ Short as the time that this system has been in operation, the results to which it has led have proved of
very great importance to the interests of navigation and commerce. The route to many of the most frequented

ports in different parts of the globe have been materially shortened3 that to San Francisco, in California, by
nearly one third. A system of southwardly monsoons in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic and on the

west coast of America has been discovered3 3 vibratory motion of the trade-wind zones and with their belts
