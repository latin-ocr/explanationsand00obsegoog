rises up again to 350 N.—to the west of the meridian of Cape St. Roque is above its highest reach to the east
of that meridian. And now that we have the fact, how obviouS, beautiful and striking is the cause ! ”

Cape St. Roque is in 50 S. Now study the configuration of the Southern American continent from this
Cape to the Windward Islands of the west IndieS, and take into account also, certain physical conditions of
these regions :—The Amazon always at a high temperature because it runs from West to East, is pouring an
immense column os warm water into this part of the ocean. As this water and the heat of the sun raise the
temperature of the ocean along the equatorial sea-front of this coast, there is no escape for the liquid element,
as it grows warmer and lighter‚ eracept to the North. The land on the South prevents the tepid waters from

spreading out in that direction as they may do to the east of 350 W.‚ for here there is a space about 180 os

longitude broad in which the sea is clear both to the North and South.

They must consequent'ly flow North. A mere inspection of the therma] chart is sufficient to make obvious
the fact, that the warm waters which are found East of the usual limits assigned the Gulf Stream, and between
the parallels of 300 and 400 Ν. do not come from the Gulf stream, but from this great equatorial cauldron,
which Cape St. Roque blocks up on the South, and which forces its overheated waters up to the 40th degree
of North latitude, not through the Caribbean sea and Gulf Stream, but over the broad surface of the left bosom

of the Atlantic ocean.

Here we are again tempted to pause and admire the beautiful revelations which in the benign system of
terrestrial adaptation, these researches unfold and spread out before us for comtemplation. In doing this, we
shall have a free pardon from those at least who delight “ to look though nature up to nature’s God.'’

What two things in nature can be apparently more remote in their physical relations to each other, than
the climate of western Europe and the profile of 3 coast line in South America? Yet this chart reveals to us
not only the fact that these relations between the two are most intimate, but makes us acquainted with the
arrangements by which such relations are established.

The barrier which the South American shore line opposes to the escape on the South, of the hot waters
from this great equatorial cauldron of St. Roque, causes them to flow North, and, in September, as the winter

approacheS, to heat up the western half of the Atlantic ocean, and to cover it with a mantle of warmth above

summer heat as far up as the parallel of 400. Here beat to temper the winter climate of western Europe is

· stored away, as in an air chamber to furnace·heated apartments3 and during the winter, when the fire of the

solar rays sinks down, the westwardly winds and eastwardly currentS, are sent to perform their office in this
benign arrangement. Though unstable and capricious to us they seem to be, they nevertheless “ fulfil His eom-
mandments’' with regularity, and perform their offices with certainty. In tempering the climates of Europe
with heat in winter, that has been bottled avt ay in the waters of the ocean during summer, they are to be re-
garded as the flues and the regulators for distributing at the right time, and at the right places, in the right
qmtities.

By March, when ἕο the winter is passed and gone‚” the furnace which had been started by the rays of
