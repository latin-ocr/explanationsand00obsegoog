it in by hand until it was quite taut, finding it would not run out except by the drift of the ship, 1 presumed it
must have reached the bottom, and ordered the line to be reeled up, when it parted at 100 sathoms from the
reel. On the 13th inst.‚ the weather smooth‚ Ι got another cast. Let go the shot at 9, and the line con-
tinued running out until 9.54‚ when it stopped‚ except as the ship drifted. At this time there were 2,200
fathoms out, and the line slaok. Reeled up 45 fathoms when the line parted. The ship’s drift dunng the

time was nearly one half of a mile.

I intend in future, when the weather will permit, to sound from a boat, as by means of the oars 1 can

keep the boat directly over the shot, and thereby be enabled to get an up and down cast.’'

“ Sin :—1 have the honor to sorward you ‘a report of the soundings taken by this vessel, with the appa·

ratus furnished us at Norfolk.

From the weakness of the line, these soundings are not so certain as they would otherwise be; the same

cause has prevented generally the attempt to take soundings.’'

These soundings it will be observed‚ like those of several other vesseIS, are obviously too defective to
challenge any considerable degree of our confidence. We have no drift in any of the soundings given by this'

vessel‚ and no remark showing why there is no drift‚ There is also a total absence of information as to the
