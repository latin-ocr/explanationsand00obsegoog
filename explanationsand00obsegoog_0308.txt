this occupies some fifteen minutes, and the boats may be rowed at the rate of six miles an hour, even over
quite a rough sea. If the whale be slow in his movementS, the boat’s crews have nothing to do while waiting
for it to appear, but to lay upon their oars ; and as the tune draws nigh, eager eyes scau all portions of the sea
around‚ to catch the first glimpse of a rising spout. But if there happen to be much swell, from the depressed
condition of the boatS, being often in a cavity between waves that entirely obstruet the vision, it is difficult to
discern a spout from boats beyond a limited distance3 in this case, the main dependence is placed on the man
at the ship’s masthead, who, as soon as he sees the whale‚ runs up a signal 3ηά points out its direction. This
creates a scramble among the mewa, as there is generally no small share os rivalry existing among them, and
all strain every nerve with the view of being the first who approach and have the honor of first implanting their
harpoons in the whale; but as the boat which is more favored by chance, or happens to out-row the others,
gets within a few yards of him, the contested race is given up, and the sternmost crews cease rowing and
silently await the issue of the first conflict. Sometimes boats approach a whale, as their situations chance to
be, by rowing up towards the head and get to the pervious part of its body in this way 3 at other times they
proceed direct to its side, but generally the most approved way is to row up from behind, and if necessary,
make a circuitous route to do so· The approach of a boat osten alarms a whale‚ when he dives beneath the
sea and suffers it to come near him no more5 but more commonly and especially on new grounds where they
have been but little disturbed, there is no difficulty in placing boats sufficiently near whales as to leave them in
the attacker’s power. It is probable, however, that boats seldom arrive near whales without their knowledge,
such only making efforts to escape as have learned to regard them as enemies by having become acquainted
with the missive weapons thrown therefrom. The harpooner rows at his oar until the boat gets nearly “within
dart,’' when he is called up by the officer who steers and controls the boat3 and when within a few feet of the
whale the progress of the boat is checked as much as possible, by strokes of the oarS. The harpooner now darts
his two harpoons which pass through the blubber and enter the fleshy mass that encloses the bones of this great
animal ; and these keen instruments coming in quiek succession often give to the affrighted whale the first
intimation of impending danger. This is always a moment of peril to the assailantS, and therefore one of
anxiety to the lookers on ; as some fearful accident might proceed from the convulsive motions os the wounded
whale, other boats promptly row up to assist the first. The skill and activity of every one are now in requisi·
tion, lest the yet slippery and valuable prize should by some means escape before receiving his death wound.
If, as osten happenS, a boat is badly stoven in the first outset, another takes in the immersed crew and tows the
stoven boat to the ship, while others make a fresh and combined attack on the whiile, which may now be
“ rolling in the ocean foam, thatlhis own struggles have produced, or perhaps rearing its mighty tail in the air,
3ηά drawing it down on the sea with such force as to make it resound to a great distance.

Soon as a boat is attached to a whale, the officer in charge exchanges situations with the harpooner or
boat steerer‚ as he is more generally called, the latter now steering the boat while the former goes sorward
and plies his lance, taking care to poise it well before throwing it, and to aim it always so that some portion

of the whale’s vitals shall be pierced. Copious emissions of blood then gush from the spout hole, rise up a few
