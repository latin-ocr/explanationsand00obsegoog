. The· deep-sea soundings of the Albany are already casting glimmers of light upon our investigations as to
the currents of the Gulf os Mexico. The sounding os April the 7th, is significant in this connection.

1 had already traced the current that flous through the Yucatan Pass on its way to seed the Gulf Stream,

and remarked the sharp turn made by it in the middle of the Gulf near the place of this soundiug. This

remarkable elevation in the bottom, would seem in this connection, to indicate that the Mississippi is pushing
out its silty harricades to keep back these salt water waveS, and to protect its own formatioris from the violence
of this mighty current of the sea.

To say the least, and to speculate no further tham may be necessary to show how rich and inviting is this
field, that 1 may tempt more lahorers into it, Ι may be permitted to remark that no attempt to investigate the
currents os the sea, or to comprehend the system of aqueous circulation that is maintained in the ocean, can
be crowned with sucesS, unless it include in it also the depth and shape os the oceanic basin.

A few ships in the different oceans, with such a corps of observers as the officers os the “Albany’' and

the “Delphin” have proven themselves to be, would in a short time enrich our knowledge in this respect, to a

vast extent.
