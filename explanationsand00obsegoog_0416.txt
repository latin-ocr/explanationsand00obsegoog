In these five passageS, after passing Cape St. quue, 1 have kept “ good full'’ and always found as
I neared the West I'ndia Islands that the ‘wind hauled favorably, 3ηά the weather became less squally.

Mernanguapa is a small port near Parahiba—See Chart.

There are few portions of the continent of America less known than from the Rio de la Plata to Cape

ὅ N orm—The above is taken from the Lug-book os the mate, the winda and latitudes are put down correctly, but the longitude is
130 151 out of the way. 1 merely put down this to show you how erroneous some persons will be. 1 gave him his longitude on the 16111,
when 1 spoke 3 vessel whose longitude agreed with mine within four miles, but iu crossing the Line, he was almost aa fiir out again. 1
crossed the Line in 340 15⁹ on 'the 5th os August, and on the 7th passed ten miles west os Fernando do N oronha, the westher clear, the
laland plainly in sight. On the 9th passed Pernambuco, 1 found no trouble in getting to the southward. It was my intention to have
stopped at Pernambuco, sor the purpose os landing some of my crew, who had mutinied on the passage, nearly killing my mate, 3ηά
shooting me with 3 pistol. Their attempt to take the vessel, left me without 3 sufficient number os men to work her, which caused my
passage to be much longer than it otherwise would have been. 1 kept but little reckoning afterwards, and that mostly in my head, sor

sear of another mutiny, for the crew shipped in N ew York for the purpose of taking the vessel, 3ηά nearly succeeded in doing so. The

weather being equally off PernambucO, 1 kept on sor St. Catharine’s and arrived there on the 22d of August, on the 23d or 24th gave my
men up to the U. S. Consul, on the Ἰὼ September, got under way from St. Catharine’s, 3ηά on the loth anchored on the bar off Rio

N egro, Patagonia. ι
Giving me 30 days to the Line.

47 days to St. Cathariue's.
56 days to Rio Negro.
