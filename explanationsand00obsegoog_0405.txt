The chief point of information as to the new route appears now to be in the pratctical answer to this ques-

tiori: Which is the best way of crossing the “ equatorial calms ? '’ The region mo'st liable to these calms is,
as Ι have before explained, wedge-shaped, with the point of the wedge directed towards South Amerina.
The winds in these calm regions are osten from the southward and westward3 indeed, as you approach the
coast of Africa in summer and fall, these southwardly winds assume the character of a regular monsoon.
The place of these calms varies too: it is sometimes at the equator; sometimes in 50, 100, or even
in 150 North, according to to the season of the year.
. And the answer to the question, “ how to across them? ’² is this: Unless you are searful of falling to lee-
ward, or γοα are already too far to leeward and want to make easting in the southwardly winds of the
“ doldrumS,” do your best to make southing, for by that course you will clear them soonest. By that course

you run directly across them ; by an East or W'est course, γοα run along with them.

 

1 was forced across the Line in Long. 320 50‘ on the 7th of February. To avoid being back-strapped, 1 stood to the East for
twelve hours between the Sth and 9th, and twenty-one and a half hours between the loth and llth 3 but 1 am now inclined to believe that

l might have fetched past St. Roque by standing on. On the llth, stood in sor the land, and made tt on the 12th at 2 p. m. At ah.
som. tacked ship in a hals twelve ε shells and gray sand mixed with coi-al, which was the general character of the soundings every time
we got bottom. Stood off shore; th. tsm. tacked and laid'up along the land, which was again made on the 13th3 stood in to ten
sathoms, and tecked at 211. 30m. p. m. ‘⁸ Cape Branco ‘’ bearing, per compaSS, S. by W. i W„ distant about thirty miles), and the land
abeam, distant about eight miles. At 9 p. m. tacked again and laid well up along the land‘vhich we did not again see till we made
“ Cape Fri0.” The wind sanned us on both tacks, and when we ‘⁸ went about ” the last time, we made a S. by E. compass course.
Thus we cleared the land in two off·shore tackS, each of 512. 30m, the current sweeping alovtg or off shore. The distance run per log
is six thousand five hundred and sixty·three miles. N ο vessel that sailed in Januery has yet arrived. We spoke the “ Green Point ''
between 10 and 20 N. and 300 540 W. bound to Rio. she had sailed two days before us (January lst) from New York. We also
saw the bark ⁸⁸ Polka '’ standing in sor the land on the asternoon os the loth Feb. We were on the opposite tack, having gone about to
avoid the bight to the westward os St. Roque.

Ι have endeavored to obtain accurate information of the passages made in December, but the Register is so loosely kept that 1 can
learn nothing more than the number os days of the voyage, not even the time of sailing or arrival, or the meridien on which they crossed

the Equator.
