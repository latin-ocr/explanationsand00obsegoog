this purpose I present sor their examination a fac simile taken from the sheet upon which Lieut. Ἐστι-881 18

engaged in marking the direction of the winds recorded in their LogS.

The entire ocean is divided into districts of 50 of lat. by 50 oslong. each, and in whatever part os 0118
of these districts·a navigator may be when he records the direction of the wind in his Log, from· that
direction the wind is assumed to be blowing at that time 31101181 that district; and this is the only assumption
that is permitted in the whole course of investigation.

Now if the navigator will draw, or imagine to be drawn, in any such district, 12 vertical columns for the 12
months—and then 16 horizonta] lines through the same district for the 16 points os the compaSS, i. 8. for N.‚
N.N. Ε., N. Ε., Ε. N. Ε., 31111 80 011, omitting the by-pointS, he will have before him a picture of the “ investi-
gating Chart,„ out of which the “Pilot Charts'’ are constructed. In this case, the alternate points of the compass
only are used3 because when sailing free, the (111-8811011 of the wind is seldom given for such points as N. by Ε., W.
by S.‚ Em. Bearing this in mind, the intelligent navigator will have no difficulty in understanding the annexed dia·
gram, (Plale 13) 31111 111 forming a correct opinion as to the degree of credit 11118 10 1118 results afforded by it.

Instead of entering the wind in the Log as from the point of the compass from which it blnws, many

seamen were too much in the habit, particularly when the wind is a little variable, to enter it as from the

“Sd. 31111 Wd.,” “Nd. and Ed.,” and so on, by quadrants.

In such 83888, 1118 officers who are conducting the investigations 318 31 3 1088 10 know how to enter such
winds on the sheet3 they do not know in the case of the entry “Nd. and Ed.,'’ for example, whether to ehter
it on the N. N. Ε., 1118 N. E. or the E. N. E. line, for these are all “ Nd. and Ede?

As soon as the attention of those who were keeping abstracts for me was called to this, they with great
promptitude and fidelity, Ι have reason to believe, 1813831811 the defect and adopted the plan recommended, by
entering the wind for the first, middle, and latter part—3 times a day—as from 1118 point of the compass from
which it most prevailed during each part. Thus three entries or scores are made on the sheet for every day—
these scores are made in the column standing for the month, and on the line standing for the point of the com-

pass from which the wind prevailed.

As the compiler wades through Log book after Log book, and scores down in column after column, and
upon line aster line, mark aster mark, he at last finds that under the month and from the course upon which
heis about to make an entry, he 1138 already made four marks or scores thus ι (llll). Τ118 0118 11131 118 1138 now
to enter will make the fifth, and he “ scores 31111 1311188 ;” 31111 80 011, 1111111 311 1118 abstracts relating 10 11131 part
of the ocean upon which. he is at work has been gone over, and his materials exhausted. These “fives an
tallies„ are exhibited on Plate 1.

He then sums up the number of winds entered from each point for each mouth, and enters the same—ex-
pressed 111 figures—in its appropriate place on the “Wind-rose” of the Pilot chart. Plate V.

' The course of the winds as given in the abstracts are compass courseS, and they are entered on his work-
ing sheet accordingly. For example: i'f the variation be more than one point, and less than three, the
compiler, when he goes to transfer results to the Pilot Chart, makes the correction sor all at once, by allowing

for two points os variation‚ so that the Pilot Chart may shew the true courses of the winds as nearly as possible
