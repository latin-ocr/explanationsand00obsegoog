Tbat it bifurcates a cold stream from the North, near the Banks os Newfoundland, and that one fork of
this stream pursues thence, on the other side of the Gulf Stream, a southwestwardly course as a current of cold

water, for the most part submarine z*
· That it is bifurcated by the British Isles :†

And that its surface is a double inclined plane, having the ridge, or line of meeting os the two planes
near the axis of the stream—from which the surface water, like the rain from the roos of a house, runs off
towards each side.‡

Thus most, if not all the conditions which the study of the subject induced mein 1844 to announce
as theoretically to exist, have since, as already remarked, been converted into physical facts by the operations
os the Coast Survey, or by the navigators who have been observing in connection with the wind and current
eharts.

The observations made in 1846 by Lieut. George M. Bache‚ U. S. N., for the Coast Survey,§ and con·
tinued in 184711 and 1848111 by Lieutenants S. P. Lee and Richard Bache upon the deep sea and surface tem·
peratures in and about the Gulf Stream, and confirmed as to the surface temperatures by these eharts‚ as well
as by the observations os Lieut. J. O. Walsh, U. S. N., while observing in connection with them in 1850.—
this mass of careful observatio'ns thus collected—all goes to confirm the theoretical suggestions os 1844 with
regard to the cotd banks and currents os cold water over or through which the Gulf Stream finds its way to
the northward.

The officers of the Coast Survey already alluded to, announced the banks of the Gulf Stream off the
coast of North Carolina and Virginia, to be a “ wall of cold wate1.” They also found, as had already been
predicted, the water at great depths to be a very low temperatum—380 Fahreuheit.

They also found on the sursace os the ocean, east of the Gulf Stream, layers or streaks of warm water3

 

⁸’²‘Apparently, in obedience to the lawa here hinted at, there is a conatam tendency of polat- wetere towards the tropica, and os
tropica! watera towards the polest—Lina. Mam-y on tlte Gulf Strenua.

“It would be curious to uncertain the routea os these under current-s on their way to the tropical regiona, which they are intended
to cool. One has been found at the equatur, 200 miles broad, and 230 colder than the sui-face water. Unleas the land or ahoals inter-
vene, it no doubt comes down in a spiral curve ς meeting the warm watera of the Gulf midway the ocean, (the cold current) divides itaelf
and runs by the side of them right back into those very roser-voirs os the &adast—nia.

r‘lt finally meets the British lalanda. By these it is divided—one part going into the polar basin of Spitzbergen ; the other en·
tering the Bay of Biscay.'’—1bid.

‡“ln a winter-’s day off Hatteraa, there is a difference between these waters os near 200. Thone of the Gulf being war-mer,
we are taught to believe that they are lighter; they should therefore occupy a higher level than those through which they float.
Assuming the depth here to be 114 fathoms, and allowrng the usual rates of expansion, figure· show that the middle of the Gulf
Str-eam here should be nearly two feet higher than the contiguous water· of the Atlantic. Were thiu the case, the nur-face os the
stream would present a double inclined plane, from which the water would be running down on either side, aa from the roos οἵ a
house. Aa this ran off at the top, the same weight of colder water would run in at the bottom ς and thus, before this mighty
stream had completed hals ita course, its depth· would be brought up to the sur-face, and its water· would be spread out over the
ocean. why then does not such a body of warm water, flowing and adhering together through a cold sea, obey thie law, and
ooeupy a higher level?”
