The wind approaches the North pole by a series of spirals from the southwest. If we draw a circle about
the North pole, on a common terrestrial globe, and intersect it by spirals to represent the direction of the wind, we
shall see that the wind enters all parts of this circle from the southwest3 and consequently that a whirl ought

to be created thereby‚ in which the ascending column of air revolves from right to left, or against the hands

of a watch.
At the South pole the winds come from the northwest, 3ηά consequently there they revolve about it with

the hands of a watch.

That this should be so, will be obvious to any one who will look at the arrows on the polar sides of the
calms of Cancer 31111 capricorn, Plate ΙΙ. These arrows are intended to represent the prevailing direction

of the wind at the surface of the earth, on the polar side of these calms.

It is a singular coincidence between these two facts thus deduced and other facts which have been
observed‚ and which have been set forth by Rubriano, Raro, Prnnmoron, and others, vizz that all rotary
storms in the northern hemisphere revolve as do the whirlwinds about the North pole, viz: from right to left,
and that all circular gales in the southern hemisphere revolve in the opposite direction, as does the whirl about
the South pole.

How can there be any connection between the rotary motion of the wind about the pole and the rotary
motion of it in a gale caused here by local agents? Ι

80 sar, we see how the atmosphere moves; but the atmosphere, like every other department in the econo-
my of nature, has is offices to perform3 and they are many. I have already alluded to some of them. But I
only propose at this time to consider some of the meteorological agencies which, in the grand design of cre·

ation, have probably been assigned to this wonderful machine.

To distribute moisture over the surface of the earth, and to temper the climate of different latitudes, it
would seem, are two great offices assigned by their Creator to the ocean and the air.

When the northeast and southeast trades meet 31111 produce the equatorial calms of the Atlantic, the air
by this time is heavily laden with moisture—for, 111 33011 hemisphere it has travelled obliquely over a large

space of the ocean. The two winds meet here with opposing forces so nicely balanced that they neutralize each

other, and a calm is the consequence3 and, as 0113 13 pressing from the North and the other from the South,
upon the belt of the atmosphere over this calm region, and each with the whole amount of force that sets it in
motion, we ought to bave in this calm region an upward motion of the atmosphere, the motive power of which
is the sum of these two forces. Now, if we had barometrical determinations accurately made-in the region of
these 0311113, we should probably obtain 311 expression, in horse power, if you please, os the whole amount of
force exer-ted by the Sun in keeping up this system of atmospherical circulation—-for it is the 11331 of the
Sun, it is thought, which causes the winds to blow and the waters to flow 3 at least, it is supposed to be the
chief source os their motive power.

The air os the equatorial calms being charged with moisture, and thus pressed upon by the trade winds

North and South, has no room for escape but in the upward direction. It expands as it ascends and becomes
