METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATmNs AT SEA. 39

hove learned that a proposition has been made, from the United States Government, conjointly, and in co-oper-
ation, a system of Meteorological observations to be made at sea, in all ships belonging to the naval service of
the two countrieS, and sufficiently simple to be participated in by the merchant service also·

“ In a partial trial which has already been made in the United StateS, it has been found to produce results
which, exclusive of their scientific bearing, are of great importance to the interests of navigation and com-
merce, in materially show-tening- passages, by the knowledge of prevailing winds and currentS, at particular
season8.” “ The practical advantage arising from the cc-ordination of the observations in the Hydrographic
office of the United States, 3ηά the circulation of the charts os the winds and currents and the sailing direc-
tions founded on them, have been such, and so appreciated, that there are now as is stated, more than 1,000
American ships engaged in making them. The request for British co-operation in an undertaking so honor-
able to the country in which it originated, was referred in the Spring of this year by the Earl of Malmesbury
¹ to the President and Council of the Royal Society for a report. ⁶ ⁶ ⁶ ⁶ ⁶ ⁶ . ⁶ ⁶
Doubtless we can now estimate only a small part of the advantages which terrestria} physics, as well as hy-
drography and navigation would ‹lerive from the concurrent exertions of the two great maratime nationS, in
the way which has been pointed out.''

Such are the reasons and the circumstances which induce me to recommend an abandonment, sor the
present, of the 13ηά portion, and to urge further action with regard to that which includes the sea. This meets
the approval of all who have expressed opinions with regard to it; many, great and obvious are the advan-
tages which it promises to navigation and commerce, and au that seems wanting now to get it fairly underway
is the adoption of the necessary preliminary arrangements. ⁸

These relate chiefly to the subjects of observations, the instruments to be used, 3ηά the modes and methods
os making the observatione and of treating them. The abstract logS, as the forms used by the American ship-
masters sor making and recording observations at sea, for this office, are called, were intended principally for
tbe commercia] marine 3 and therefore they only embrace such objects, and require only such instruments as
the masters of American merchant vessels generally are accustomed to use and to make.

These observations have been carried farenough to show the great need there is for nicer instrumentS, for
more accurate observationS, and for including among the objects to be observed, certain things which are
generally passed over unobserved by navigatore.

As itis desired‚ therefore, that the navies of all maratime natione should co-operate and make these obser-
vations in such a manner and with such means and implements, that the system may be uniform, 3ηά the
· observatione made on board one public ship be readily referred to and compared with the observatione made
on board all other public shipS, in whatever part of the world 3-And moreover, as it is desirable to enlist the
voluntary co-operation of the commercial, as well as the military marine of all nations, in this system of re-
search, it becomes not only proper, but politic, that the forms of the abstract logs to be used, the description
of the instruments to be employed, the things to be observed, with the manipulation of the instruments, and

the methods 3ηά modes of observation should be the joint work of the principal parties concerned.
