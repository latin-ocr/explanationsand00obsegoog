crossing the line in May, that the suggestions which 1 have already made with regard to the route for cross·
ing in March and April, may be repeated for May, also ; only for May a route a little more to the Westward
would be well.

In this month the navigator may carry the S. E. tradeS, (and the N. E. trades also,) sarthor North, than

he will in April or March. In neither of these months will he find the belts of equatorial calms and the light
airs os the “ Horse Lat‘itudes’‘ very difficult to cross‚ His course across them should be as nearly due North·

as he can make it.

The June passages give us a little more experience as to the relative advantages of certain crossings
This month affords data for drawing a comparison as to the crossings between 1000 and 1050, 1050 and 1100,
1100 and 1150. From the first crossing we have the passages of four vessels to Calisornia3 from the second,
twelve, and from the last, six.

Among the first were the “ Sea Serpent„ and “Governor Morton,” the one having 88, the other 91 days,
from New York. Among the second were the “ Wild Pigeon‚” and the “Ion‚” having 89 and 99 days,
respectively, from New York to the Line—18 and 34 days thence to San Francisco.

Among the six which crossed between 1100 and 1150, 1 recognize no clipper. The “Mary Reed,'’

which vessel 1 do not know, came from Valparaiso. She crossed in 1150 and had 16 days thence to San

Francisco.

It appears therefore that, as far as this table is concerned, we are left in as much doubt as to the best
crossing in June, as we are with regard to other months3 though the indications seem to suggest, and other
circumstances indicate, that in this month vessels should not cross to the East of 1050. Perhaps near 1200
will be found the best crossing place3 for the reason that there, the belt os equatorlal calms wlll not be so
difficult to cross: that in this month also, the S. E. trades will sometimes be carried as far as 100 N.: and
that the N. E. trades are better winds the farther you are from the American coast.

July seems to be one of the most difficult months for a good passage from any crossing to Cali-
fornia. The influence upon the windS, of the Great Salt Desert and other arid plains of the interior,
begins now to be felt far out to sea. The effect is, uncertain and light N. E. trades, with a broad belt os
equatorial calmS.

1 do not recognize a single clipper among the ships that have crossed the equator in the Pacific in this
month. Among the 22 J uly crossingS, the “Staffordshire,” and the “ Cahota‚” from 1080 and 1100 W„ give
the shortest passages—the former os 18, the latter of 23 days to San Francisco.

But the indications are, that by crossing in this month between 1150 and 120⁰, or even to the West of

1200, you will have a more certain passage, and on the average, one that is shorter than you will make by

crossing further to the eastward.

In August, the data are very meagre. In this mouth we have the tracks of three clipper ships, viz z the

“ N. B. Palmer,” that crossed the Line 88 days from New York, in 1140, with 19 days thence to California3

the “ Uggm'„ that 91 days out crossed the Line in 1010, with 28 days thence to San Francisco 3 and the
