These investigat'ions show that the trade wind regions of the ocean, beyond the immediate vicinity of the
land, are, sor the most part, rainless regions} and that the trade-wind zones may be described in a hyetographic

sense as the evaporating regions.

They also show, or rather indicate as a general rule, that‚· leaving the polar limits of'the two trade wind
systems, and··approaching the‘nearest· pole, theprecipitation is greater than the evaporation, until the point of
maximum cold is reached. .

They' 2:130 indicate as a gemae mie, that the s, Ὲ. aad N„ E. trade winda which come from a

‘The results of these charts, therefore,· suggest the inquiry as to the sufficiency of the Atlantrc, after supply*

Returning now to the trade winds os the Atlantio 2-—There is between the two systems, a region of calma,
known as the equatorial ealms. It hasa mean average breadth of about six degrees of latitude. In this
region, the air which is brought along to the equator by the N„ E. and S. E. trades, aseends.

1f we liken ‘the belt of equatorial oalms to an immense atmospherical trough, extending, as it does,
entirely around the earth, and is we liken the N; E. and S. Ε. trade winds to two streams discharging themselves
into it, we shall see that we have two currents perpetually running in at the bottom3 and that therefore we
must have ‘as much air as the two currents bring in at the botto‘m, to‘ ssow out' at the top. What flows out 'at
the top is carried back north and south, bythese upper curren't8,'which are thus proved to exist and to flow
counter to theti-ade winda.

Using still further this mode of illustration 3-—if we liken the calm belt 'of Cancer,·and the calm belt 'of Ca·

primm, each to a great atmospherical trough extending around the earth also, we· shall see that in this case
'the currents are running in· at the top and out at' the bottomt here the currentfrom the equator meets in' the

upper regions, the current {rom the poles3 the two' descend3 and the atmosphere which they thus pour into
’ these belts run out at the bottom—-on one side towards the equator, as the perpetual trade'winds ;—on theothor,

towards the poles as the prevailing winds of the the regions between these belts and the polar circles.

The belt of equatorial oalms is a belt of constant precipitation. Capt. wnkes, of the Exploring'ssxpedi·
