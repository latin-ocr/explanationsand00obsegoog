was resolved to give it up and return to the United States.

We therefore retraced our steps to the southward. The ice that had so much impeded our progress upward,
had entirely disappeared. We touched for refreshments by the way, at some of the settlements on the coast of
Greenland, where we were most kindly and hospitably received by the Danish authorities,

Leaving Holsteinberg on the 6th of September for New York, the two vessels were separated in a gale

By an act of CongresS, approved March 3d, 1849, the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to assist me
in the undertaking to investigate the phenomena os the winds and the waveS‚ to find short routeS, and to dis·
cover matters of importance to Commerce and Navigation. The following is the joint resolution which ex·

pressed the wishes of Congress in the matter .—
“ Saea-10⁸ 2. And be it further emeted, That the Secretary of the Navy be directed to detail three

‘ suitable vessels of the navy in testing new routes and perfecting the discoveries made by Lieut. Maury in

‘ the course of his investigations of the winds and currents of the ocean3 and to cause the vessels of the navy
‘ to co·operate in procuring materials for such investigation5‚ in so far as said co-operation may not be incom-

‘ patible with the public interest: Provided, That the same can be accomplished without any additional

‘ expense.”

But one vessel has been detailed for this service, and she unfortunately proving utterly unseaworthy,

her cruise was broken up before it was half completed.
