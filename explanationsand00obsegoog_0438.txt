miles of Cape Horn.”

Cape Horn navigators should not forget that the prevailing winds encountcred in doubling the Cape are
westerly winds3 that the AndeS, which in fact terminate only with the continent, stand up as a barrier to
these winda, and consequently these winds come around the Cape in violent sweep3, puff-t, and galeS, as
they do arournd the bluff point of land in a harbor, or the corner of a building on shore3 and that the strength
of these sweeping winds is probably felt with more force near the Cape than it is at a considerable distance off,
and out of the influence of the land upon the course and velocity of the wind.

Therefore, Ι would advise navigatore in doubling the Cape, first to pass through the straits of Le Mane,
if practicable, and if they can accomplish it by daylight—for the currents are strong and conflicting there—
to hug the Cape as closely as the winds on one hand, and the rocks on the other, will allow, and so make
westing down there when the degrees are short, as fast as without fighting adverse winds and weather they
may do, until they cross—if bound to California—the parallel os 500 S. between the meridians of 800 and
900 West.

But, if after getting through the straitS, and before doubling the Cape, a westerly gal-e strike them in the
teeth, then instead of stopping there off the pitch of the Cape to fight against it, with the intention of holding their
own till the gale abateS, or wind slants so as to let them get round, I think the chauces would be altogether in
their favor, by sticking her away South, under the expectation that they would soon get out of the strength of the
winds which} eddy ·1il-.·e, come sweeping around Cape Horu, sometimes at one distance, sometimes at another,
according to the direction of the gale. But even in doingthis, the navigator who is desirous os makinga quick
passage, will not fail to take advantage ofslants. He will always prefer, until he doubles the Cape, the tack
upon which he can make the most westing. Vessels intending to touch at Valparais0‚ or any os the “ Inter·

medioS,” need not care to get so far West while they are South of the parallel os 500, even when the winds
