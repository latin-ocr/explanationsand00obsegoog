The sperm whale has (as you remark) generally been sought after and found within 300 each side of the

equator, and as long as they can be found in a friendly clime, where the sea is smooth and weather pleasant,
they will be sought after there, and probably they would remain in low latitudes where the sea is smooth and

their food abundant, if they were not barrassed, wounded and frightened away. Be this as it may, you may

. rely upon it, sperm whales are found, and many thousands of barrels of their oil been taken off the S. W. coast

of Chiloe and off Gaufor, latitude 440 S. 3 also off the Chatham IslandS, latitude 440 S., and amongst the
Eleoutian Islands, (N. Pacific,) latitude 530 N. But after all, the great bulk of the fleet will be found cruising
in every sea from the equator to 350 each side.

You ask if ‘ I or Captain Post, or some one else cannot give a similar chapter on the right whale, and if
they and the sperm are ever found together, and if they fightst

In my letter of the oth of February, you will notice my description, somewhat in detail, of the habits of
the right whale. The right and sperm whales, though sometimes seen near each other, 1 have no idea they
ever mix, mingle, associate or fight3 their foed being entirely different, they are a different animal, having no
affinity with each other, nor have I any knowledge that right whales ever fight each other3 they seem to be
lonely in their habits, sometimes they go in paim, and at other times 4 or 5 will be seen together, but when
they couple or cohabit together they meet indiscriminately and seem to indulge an indiscriminate intercourse.
Shoals of each sex meeting together,—at this interview the bulls particularly are very wild; they bellow and
roar like lions, breaching, rolling, and threshing about, lashing the ocean to foam with their huge flukes;
and seem more intent on business than pleasure; it is exceedingly dangerous to attack them at this time,
this mad phrenzy is soon over, when they separate, and resume their lonely wanderings over the ocean for sood.

The charts you sent I will distribute with a special request ‘to use the water thermometer freely.' It
would give me great pleasure to furnish any additional remarks or thoughts upon whales. I do not know at
present anything more I can write3 should you wish me to investigate further, you will please inform me, and

Ι will if possible comply.’'

 

Eoetract from W S. Haven’s letter to Geo. Manu-ing—Sag Harbor, Sept. 17th, 1849.

“ Your first question is as to the yield of the whale3 Answer, Mr. Ε. says the largest whale taken in the
Polar sea in the Superior made 180 barm-218, the smallest made 120 barrels of oil„of a good quality, limpid, and
equal to the best: oil found in the whales taken on the coast of Kamschatka. Your next query, ‘ do the whales
sound under the ice ?’ Answer, they saw no ice, therefore cannot tell whether they do or not. Question‚ ‘if he
has any bones (so I read it) should like the loan of them:’ Answer, he has nonesneither has 113 any drawings
of any kind of whale. The description he gives is as follows: The whales taken in the Polar 333 were all of
the Right or Black Whale specieS, of a deep black color, having head much longer than the black whale usually

has, and more crooked, drooping at the extreme, and without the protuberance near the end technically called

the bonnet in other whales; saw a few white flukes or tails as you would call them; the head being

longer; the whalebone was found of a corresponding length, being also much longer and smoother but not so
