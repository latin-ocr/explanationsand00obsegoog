might be supposed, from such anumber of active and intelligent observem, we are collecting materials of great

value.

During the course of these investigationS, many interesting facts have been developed, amounting, in
some 03333, 10 actual discoveries of great interest—such as a new route, which shortens the sailing distance 10
1113 equatur, some fifteen or twenty per cent„ and, of course, proportionately to all ports beyond 3—the exist-

ence in the North Atlantic of a regular monsoon—and in the North Pacilic near the West course, of a perpetnal

south west trade wind, near the equator--a unique phenomenon 3 3130, 1113 existence, near the same place, osa ,

system os 3101130033.

My present purpose, however, it not to speak of these discoveries, but rather to treat of the 'insiglit which
these investigation8‚ undertaken on such alarge scale, afford as to the general system of atmospherical circu·

lation over the earth.

They teach us to regard the atmosphere as a vast machine, that is apparently tasked to its utmost ; but .

as one that is always in order and never breaks down.

lt 13 3 sewer into which, with 'every breath, we cast vast quantities of dead animal matter. It is a labora·
tory, into which, when the light and heat enter, they act upon this dead matter, decompose it, and resolve it
into gaseous substances‚ to be by the action again of certain imponderable agentS,condensed into plants and trees.

If it were not sor this condensation‚ the air would become tainted; it would send its impurities back into
the lungs; and continually receiving back more dead matter in return, it would finally become unfit for the
respiration of certain anim‘als, 3ηά man would perish from the face of the earth.

We hunger: we take as food‘that which 1133 been gathered from the vegetable kingdom, into the stomach 3
there we elaborate it into flesh and blood. After it has coursed through the system, and performed its office, it is
again cast forth into the atmosphere, to be reconverted into more vegetableS, to serve as food for other animals.
Doubtless the anirnal and vegetable kingdoms are in exact counterpoise 3 the one destroying, the other re·
arranging and rendering fit for use again, this same dead matter. In Infinite Wisdom, the two kingdoms are
so balanced that there is not an insect too much on one side, nora green leaf to little on the other. The atmos-
phere affords that compensation by which the proper proportions of each are maintained.

These are only some of the operations that are carried on daily and hourly through the machinery of the
atmosphere which we are breathing. How important and profitable, therefore, does the study of its laws be-
come!

Itis an engine which pumps our rivers up from the sea, and carries them through the clouds 10 their sources
in the mountains. Air and water are the great agents of the sun in distributing his beat over the surface
of the globe, cooling this climate and tempering that3 and in this light, I propose to concidet the winds and
to allude to the currents of the sea.

Though the winds blow here from the four quartem, 3ηά sometimes with such violence as to fill the mind
with emotions of terror, yet such winds‚ in comparison with the general system os atmospheric circulation, are

but eddies to the main current. They have no more effect in deranging or disturbing that system of circula·
