These extracts are taken at random. They will give those who have not access to the charts some idea
of the change of temperature in these streaks of cold and warin water. They will also afford a clue as to the
frequency with which these cold and warm streaks change their positions.

There is on this route a peninsula or island of cold water, which hangs down into the Gulf Stream like a
curtain dropped from the North. Its position, as well as its dimensione, vary. It often covers several degrees
in extent—and it affords instances of the greatest and most sudden changes that are known to take place in the

temperature of the sur-sace waters of the sea. It is generally found about the parallel of 450,- and the meridian

Ι of 500. Covering frequently an area of hundreds of miles in extent, its waters differ as much as 200, 250

300; and in rare caseS, even as much as 350 os temperature from those about it.

These waters, doubtle83‚ come down from the cold ’regions of the north, and are perhaps in the strongest
part of that current.

The bottom of the sea in that region—the Grand Banks—assist, no doubt, in forcing this mass of cold

water-s to the surface3 and the fact that they penetrate far down across the usual track of the Gulf Stream, at
