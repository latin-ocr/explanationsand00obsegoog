nomn ‘ro aro, nro. 365

For this month, we have the means of ten tracks for the average for the new, and eight by the old tontes·

1 have nothing to say about the schooner “ Wilmington,” except that she appears to have had bad luck,

as vessels by every route will occasionally have. She was becalmed 9 days between the parallels of 50 and 70
North.

The brig “ Smyrna,” after getting down to the region of equatorial calmS, departed form the new route

and went as far as 170 30' W., where she was fighting with calms and baffiing airs sor 13 dayS, for that is the

        
 

     
 
 

 

 

 

        
 

 

      

 

 

In the month of June, vessels are recommended to gn, under certain circumstanceS, as far East as 280,
and to cross the equator in about 300 W. See the route for Rio for that month, p. 352.

The mean crossing place of these ten vessels, whose tracks are given, is in Long. 280 50‘ W. on the equa-
tor. By the old route it ia, for the mean of 9, in 230 44', or 50 further East.

The shortest way generally of clearing the equatorial calms, is to go straight across them by a North or
South course In their helt, the light airs that blow are really baffiing winds which, for the rnost part, are

from the southward. As you go East‚ this belt of calms grows wider, and therefore the more difficult is it to

1 time it took her to get from 90 to 20 North.
Yet notwithstanding all this, the average of all their passages by the new route, counting the ‘⁶ Smyrna,’'
which went part of the way only by the new route, is 8.4 days less than by the old.
1f we exclude the “ Smyrna„ from both, the new route would show a gain on the average of 10 days
for May.
