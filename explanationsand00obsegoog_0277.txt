times almost cutting it in two as it were, seems to indicate that their momentum here is greater than the mo-
mentum os the warm waters os the Gulf Stream, which they push aside ; orit may be that this part ot'the ocean
is very shallow. It would be interesting to ascertain as to this with lead and line.

Between this peninsula of cold water and Newfoundland there is a layer or branch of warm waters ; perhaps
these are brought there by a bifurcation os the Gulf Stream Here we have clearly and unexpectedly unmasked
the very seat os that agent which produces the Newfoundland fogs. Itis spread out over an area frequently em-
bracing several thousand square miles in extent, covered with 00Ῑά water, and surrounded on three sides, at least,
with an immense body of warm. May it not be that the proximity to each other of these two very unequally
heated surfaces out upon the ocean would be attended by atmospherical phenomena not unlike those of the
land and sea breezes ? These warm currents of the sea are powerful meteorological agents. I have been
enabled to trace in thunder and lightning, the influence of the Gulf Stream in the eastern half of the Atlantic as
far North as‘the parallel of550 N .; for there in the dead of winter, a thunder storm is not unusual.

Reviewing now what has been said concerning the layers of cold and warm water along the European
route of the Gulf stream, and returning to the cool and warm streaks mentioned by Lieut. Walsh, and
claimed by the Coast Survey as the discovery of a “branch” from the Gulf Stream3 it appears probable that
the warm waters which they encountered, and reported as coming from the Gulf Stream, are the warm waters
properly due the latitude, and the effect os the South America shore line as far as Cape St. Roque, in sending
North, its warm waters. The difference os temperature may be partly due, also, ,ὲο the warm waters of the sur·
face being separated into streaks by the cooler waters of the submarine current which by the agitation of the
ocean are here and there brought to the surface through the thin layer os warm surface water.

If we draw a line of a degree or two in breadth from the capes of the Chesapeake and the Delaware
Bays towards Cape St. Roque in Brazil, we shall find in this direction, aster crossing the Guls Stieam, a re·
markable layer of 00Ῑά water. This layer extends to the equator, and it is more clearly marked at some seasons
of the year than at others t—so much so that I have been at a loss to account for it. Like an immense lake, it
is surrou nded with water of a higher temperature. It cannot therefore be brought there by a cold surface cur·
rent. lt is strictly a layer, in contradistinction to a current.

The only idea that has suggested itself in explanation of this phenomenon is in the conjecture that there .
may be stretching off in this direction, a submerged mountain range or ridge at the bottom of the sea, across
which the cold waters of this submarine current, as it forces itself down towards the equator, are brought to
the surface by the agitation of the waves.

Standing out like peaks in this range are the islands os Fernando de Noronha, the Penedo de San Pedro,
and the Bermudas. The islands and mountains os Cuba occupy a position which a mountain spur from this
sunken range might be supposed to occupy.

Lieut. Walsh, in the “Taney,” was directed to run across this supposed submarine range of mountains

azig·zag line os deep-sea soundings from the equator to the capes of Virginia. But unfortunately his schooner
proved unseaworthy, and he had to abandon this interesting part of his work.
