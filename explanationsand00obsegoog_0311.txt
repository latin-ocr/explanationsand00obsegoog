There have indeed been some curiouS‚ but theoretical rather than practical, machinos constructed for

“Sltooting wholes,” and also fanciful contrivances designed to explode in the animal and blow it up. But
nothing has yet been fabricated for sending a harpoon, that is at all comparable to a pair of nervous and dexter·
ous armS, more especially if these happen to belong to a stout heart. That however a portable piece of mech·
anism can be put together which will fully answer the end of throwing the missive weapon and destroying the
whale with less risk of human lise than the means now employed, is undoubtedly within the bounds of possi·
bility. The chief difficulty, however, seems to be that of constructing an engine of this sort which shall
possess sufficient projectile force to enable the shooter to remain securejn the distance, and yet be of dimin·-

ished size and weight, so as not to occupy much space nor add materially to the weight of a boat.

Whale boats are necessarily nutshells of fabricS, there being not a board in one, from the keel to the gun·
wale, that measures one half i’nch in thickness, and this os the lightest material.'’

 

From capt. Daniel McKenzie to Lieut. Maury-
an Bnnronn, June 8, 1849.

“ Srn t Having perused the foregoing reminiscemes os my friend Capt. Post, who is an intelligent sailor,
and has commanded a whale ship on several successful voyages‚ 1 have no hesitation in saying they entirely
agree with my views and experience3 hope, therefore, they may be found useful to you.

Having copied several of Capt. Post‘s sea journals for you, in one of which found the foregoing, (written

out probably at sea,) and being much in detail, possibly may assist you in your great work3 have therefore
taken the liberty to forward them.''

 

The sam to the sam-„meo Bedford, Jtme meh, 1849.

¹³ Your communication of the 13th instant is received, contents duly noticed. 1 am most happy to learn
thut the books and letters Ι sent you in relation to sperm whale8‚ δια, and also the statement wrote out by
Captain Post, will be found useful. Captain P. is now absent, he commands the Barque Pliades of this port,
and is on his passage to California on a gold-digging expedition, and has your charts from me; he will
probably return you a valuable abstract log of his voyage.

You mention that you ‘should not infer from the chart which is devoted to the whaleS, that the sperm
whale has so wide a range across the ocean, as 1 and Captain Post seem to think, and should say the sperm
whale in the Pacific is found almost exclusively within the tropics, or rather within 300 each side of the
equatur, and that the right whale is as seldom found within that zone as the sperm is found without it)

Your inference (as a general rule) from the recorda you have had of the haunts most frequented, andlong
cmised around, both for right and rspei-111 whales, is correct3 that right whales are always found without the
tropics is true, with the exceptions of a very few instances where cows in cmising along a coast secking a
still bay to calve, will enter the tropics, but their home and food is always found in a high latitude, and are

sought after thween the 30111<> and 60111ο of latitude‚ generally from 350 to 450.
