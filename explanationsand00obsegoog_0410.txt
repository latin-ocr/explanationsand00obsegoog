11 appears by these tables that the average passages to the equator, by the new route, from June to De·

Ι1181111181· inclusive, have been greatly reduced 3 that the average passage to the Line for any month, is not over 34

days; and that the shortest average for any mouth is 26 days,

Moreover, by comparing the new route tracks with the “ middle route‚’' as the tracks made by those nav·

igators who attempt 10 “ split the difference‘' between the old route and the new are called, we shall see how

much they lose: thoy lose on the average, during a portion of the year, 3 week or more, and several days

at any season.

It will not escape the notice of men who study these tables 38 carefully 38 they ought to be studied, that

from May to November, inclusive, vessels that go the new route cross the parallelos 5Ο Ν., sarther to the

Eastward on the average, than they do the Equator. The cause of this is obvious: it is owing to the Mon-

soons of the “ Doldrums.’' Hence we deduce a rule which will apply to all 1110111118, 31111 it is this: When

 

⁸* Should not have car-ed to make any more eusting- than she could help, after this.
‘tEntered the “Daturum-’2 too far to the eastward.
tstarted on the new route, but abandoned it.
