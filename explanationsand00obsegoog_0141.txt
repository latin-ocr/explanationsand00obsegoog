much of the power of gravity applied to the dynamical forces of the ocean. And this power is derived from the
salts of the sea, through the agency of sea shells and other marine animals, that of themselves scarcely possess

the power of locomotion. Yet they have power to put the whole sea in motion, from the equator to the poleS,

from the surface to the bottom. ·
Those powerful and strange equatorial currents which navigators tell us they encounter in the Pacific

ocean--to what are they due? Coming from sources unknown, they are lost in the midst of the ocean. They
appear to originate in the open sea, and in the open sea to terminate. How far may they be due to the de-
rangement os equilibrium arising from the change of specific gravity caused by the secretions of the myriads

of marine animals that are continually at work in those parts of the ocean? These abstract from sea water

solid matter enough to build continents os.

Thus when we consider the salts of the sea in onc point of view, we see the winds and the marine animals
operating upon the waters, and in certain parts of the ocean deriving from the solid contents of the same, those
very principles of antagonistic forces which hold the earth in its orbit, and preserve the harmonies of the universe.

The sea breeze and the sea shell, in performing their appointed offices, act in such a way as to give rise
to a reciprocating motion in the waters: thus they impart to the ocean dynamical forces for its circulation,

The sea breeze plays upon the surface: it converts only fresh water into vapor, and leaves the solid matter
behind. The surface water thus becomes specifically beavier, and sinks. On the other hand, the little marine
architect below, as he works upon his coral edifice at the bottom, abstracts from the water there a portion of
its solid contents3 it, therefore, becomes specifically lighter, and up it goes ascending to the top with increased
velocity, to take the place of the descending column, which by the action of the winds has been sent down
loaded with fresh food and materials for the busy little mason in the depths below.

Seeing then that the inhabitants of the sea with their powers of secretion are competent to exercise at

least some degree of influence in disturbing equilibrium—are not these creatures entitled to be regarded as

agents which have their offices to perform in the system of oceanic circulation? It is immaterial how great or how
small that influence may be supposed to be3 for be it great or small, we may rest assured it is not a chance
influence, but it is an influence exercised—if exercised at all—by design, and according to the command-

ment of Him whose “ voice the winds and the sea obey.'' Thus God speaks through sea-shells to the ocean.

lt may therefore be supposed that the arrangements in the economy of *nature are such as to require that
the various kinds of marine animals, whose secretions are calculated to alter the specific gravity of sea water,
to destroy its equilibrium, to beget currents in the ocean, and to control its circulation, should be distributed
according to order.

Upon this supposition—the like of which nature warrants throughout her whole domain—we may conceive
how the marine animals of which we have been speaking, assist also to regulate climates and to adjust the tem-
perature of certain latitudeS. For instance, let us suppose the waters in a certain part of the Torrid Zone to be
700, but by reason of the fresh water which has been taken from them in a state of vapor, and consequently by

reason of the proportionate increase of salts, these waters are beavier than waters that may be cooler* but not
