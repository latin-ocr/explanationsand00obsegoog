The Mediterranean has to give those winds three times as much vapor as it receives from them 3 the Red
sea gives them as much as they will take, and receives nothing back in return3 the Persian Gulf also
gives more than it receives, What becomes of the rest? Doubtless it is given to the winda, that they may
bear it off to distant regimm, and make lands fruitsul, that but for these sources of supply would be almost
rainless, if not entirely arid, waste and barren.

These seas and arms of the ocean now present themselves to the mind as counterpoises in the great
hygrometrica] machinery of the Earth. As sheets os water placed where they are, to balance the land· in the
trade-wind region of South America, and South Africa, they now present themselves. When the foundations
of the Earth were laid, we know who it was that “ measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted
out the heavens with a span, and comprehended the dust of 'the Earth in a measure, and weighed the moun-
tains in scales, and the hills in a balance.”

Here then we see harmony in the winds, design in the mountains, order in the sea, arrangement in the
dust. Here are signs of beauty and works of grandeur3 and we may now fancy, that in this exquisite system
of adaptations and compensatiuns, we can almost behold in the Red and Mediterranean seas the very water-s
that were held in the hollow of the Almighty hand, when He weighed the Andes and balanced the hill: of
Africa in His comprehensive scaleS.

In that great inland basin of Asia which holds the Caspian sea, and embraces an arrear of one million
and a half of geographical square miles of land, we see the water surface so exquisitely adjusted, that it is
just sufficient, and no more, to return to the atmosphere as vapor, exactly as much moisture as the atmosphem
lends in rain to the rivers of that basin.

Thus we may regard the Mediterranean, the Red sea and Persian Gulf aa rclays, distributed along the
route of these thirsty winds from the continents of the other hemisphere, to supply them with πωροι-8, or to
restore to them that which they have lest behind to seed the sources of the Amazon, the Niger, aad the Congo-

In contemplating the office os the winds in the distribution of moisture over the Earth‚ we may liken then
to messengers that are heavily tasked, being laden with as much as they can hear. The load of water given
to them to carry away from the sea into the recesses of the most distant mountains, becomes too beaw, and
there it is precipitated as mountain torrente. There is then a change of temperature3 the atmosphete is invigo·
rated3 and straightway the winda commence to lift up their‘load again; taking as before a large portion of
that which they had just let down to rest. Thus: Δ

Α change occurs in the sublime economy, by which to-day the winds are relieved of their lond in one part
of the valley of the west3 they precipitate and pass on. To-morrow fresh air arrives; and it commences
straightway to take up this load again—to evaporate from leaf, twig and soil all the moisture it can find, and
to bear it off to make rains for the Lake country or some other land.

The change of temperature from day to day accomplishes important ends in the grand arrangementfor

giving circulation to moisture and rains to the Earth. According to the beautiful series of observations,
