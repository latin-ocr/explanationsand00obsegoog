But unlike the ringo of saturn through the teiescope, the outer suffaoe or the uppen- side to us, of this
cloud-ring, would appear exceedingly jagged, rough and nneven.

The rays of the Sun playing upon this peak, and then upon that, of the upper cloud surface, melt away
one set of elevatione, and create another set of depressiones. The whole stratum is, it may be imagined, in
the most turgid state3 it is in continued throes when viewed from above: the beat which is ‚liberated from
below in the process of condensation, the currente of wat-m air ascending from the Earth, aad &ceoldw-
ingfrom the sky, aJl, we may well conceive, tend to keep the upper cloud sarraca in a perpetual state of
agitation, upheaval and depression.

Imagine in such a cloud stratum an electrical discharge to take piace3 the repunt balag caught up by the

No physical fact is too bald for observation3 physical facts are the languagc of nature, and every ex·
