been made in the United States; and the practical and useful application which has been made of these
observatione„ that have been collected under the direction of the Navy Department. The transmission os these
for the inspection of the officers osher Brittanic Majesty, who are engaged or interested in similar observationS‚

is respectsully suggested and submitted for your decision.

Although 1 concur in the opinion of Lieut. Maury, that it would be inexpedient to substitute, at this time,
the plan for observations proposed by General Burgoyne‚ for that now followed in establishments and vessels
under the direction of the Navy Department3 changes and additions could probably be made, which could

secure a nearer approach to uniformity in our shore establishments, without producing confusion, and they are

respectfully recommend to that extent.

The suggestions sor a more general and widely extended co-opemtion upon some uniform plan, promises
so many advantageS, that hopes may be reasonably indulged for its eventual adoption. ·

Notwithstanding strict uniformity cannot be yet secured between the observations made by our officers
and the British Sovereign's‚ an interchange os such observations or of the deductions drawn from them, seems
to be very desirable, and a proposal for such exchange is respectfully suggested.

With much respect, Ῑ am,

Your obedient servant,
’ cHAS. Monam, chief ff Bureau.
To the Hon. ΨΜ. A. Guneus,
Secretary of the Navy.
