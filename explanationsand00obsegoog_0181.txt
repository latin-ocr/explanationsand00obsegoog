The larger twine is capable of bearing a weight of 150 lbs. 5,ooo sathoms of it are furnished to every
ship, on a reel of multiplied motion, capable of reeling up quickly, and of recovering the line and lead, when
the depth is not over 1‚000 or 2,ooo fathoms‚.and when other conditions are favorable for so doing.

To sound, take advantage of calms or of good weather, when the sea is not rough, and when the drift of
the ship will not be rapid, and sound from the weather gangway, or from a boat lowered for the purpose.
,Let the shot or lead take the twine as fast as it will, as the chip does the log line, and carefully note the time
as the line goes out, by the 400, the 600 and the 1,000 fathom marksl* Note also the drist, and every cir-
cumstance connected with the operation, and enter them upon the log, stating in every instance of losS, the
quantity of twine lost, and the quantity remaining on the reel.

Ualess it be in parts of the ocean where soundings have before been made, and where there is reason to
believe that the depth is less than 5,ooo fathomS, it is not desirable to attempt to sound with less than that
quantity of small twine on the reel.

For further information upon the subject, officere are referred to the chapter on Deep Sea SoundingS, 3d†
edition Maury’s Sailing DirectionS.

It is not desirable to have soundings repeated about those places at which bottom has already been re·

ported in that work.

Vessels bound round either Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, will economise their sounding mate-
rials until they reach the parallel of Rio de J aneiro. Deep sea soundings off those capes and beyond, in the

Indian ocean, on the one hand, and to both the South and North Pacific on the other, are much desired.

Two or three more lines of soundings across the Carribean sea and Gulf of MexioO, to cross the “ Al-
bany’s” soundings, are also particularly desired. ·

When the large twine is used, as it may be gradually, when near the land, and as it is supposed it may
also frequently be done upon the open sea, both in the Indian and Pacific oceans, it should be armed, and the
specimens brought from the bottom, put in a phial, carefully labelled, with the depth, the latitude, and long·
itude, and returned to the Bureau os Ordnance and Hydrography‚ but not through the mil.

The directions and General Order os June lst, 1850, are hereby revoked, so far as they conflict with

these, as are the directions inserted in Maury’s Sailing Directions, 3d edition, pages 70 and 71†.

The “ Albany's'' deep sea Soundinys.
The U. S. Ship “ Albany,'' Commander Chas. T. Platt, was among the first vessels equipped for this in·-

teresting service. Her cruising ground was the West India station. Her commander and the officers on board

entered heartily into the spirit of deep sea soundingS, and have been unocasing in their attention to them.
