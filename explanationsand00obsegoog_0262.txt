stand W. S. W. through C, for then the chauces are 54 in a hundred that he will have the wind directly in
his teeth; still a vessel may pass through this square 7 times, and each time find, as the chart shews it is pos-
sible, though hardly probable she may find, the wind exactly in the opposite directior).

With this full explanation as to the process by which the new routes here recommended are discussed
and discovered, the intelligent navigator who adopts thern, will percerve that these discoveries and these 1011105
310 110 11131101 os opinion with me; but that they are the results of the experience of all the navigators com-
bined, whose observations have been used in the construction of the 0113115.

111 1110 European voyages Ι 113νο found not much room for improvement as to 1011105, except to those ship-
masters who are just entering that trade; to them, these charts give all the information as to winds, currentS,
and routes that is possessed by the oldest and most experienced “Packet Captain.”

When navigators generally shall agree to follow these new 1011105, 1110 average sailing passage between
Europe and America will, it is believed, from what 1135 already been done, be considerably shortened.

But tbe new 1011105 which these charts have suggested 10 1110 equator, and which lead through parts of the
ocean in which the winds and currents were not 50 well understood as they are along the tracks to Europe,
have been attended with more decided advantage, and the most signal 51100055. Practically, they have brought
the markets of India and the southern hemisphere many days nearer to our 110015.

The route of all vessels bound into the southern hemisphere, whether their destination be the markets of
South America, of the Pacific or Indian ocean, is the same as far as the equator: and these chartshave· actually
shortened the average passage hence to the equator, from two days to two weekS, or more, according to the
season of the year3 this is shown by the results of actual trial. More than a hundred passages have been
made by these chartS‚ and according to the routes prescribed. The average length of passage by the old
route from the ports of the United States to the line, is forty·one dayS. The average passage by the new
routcs has been so sar, for January, 31 days; sor February, 253 for March, 2733 April 28& May, 34,
June, 333 July, 403 (by the old route in this month the passage is 48 dayS,) sor August, 41 ; for September3
393 sor October, 373 November, 32, and December, 34, against 383 by the old route sor December. <

As I write, I receive the abstract logs of the U. S. S. “ Saratoga,” (Captaiu Walker,) and of the mer·
chant barque “ Dragon‚'‘ (Captain Andrew.)

They sailed at the same time, both in the month of September last, (1850 3) the “ Saratoga” took the
old route3 went as far as 190 of west longitude; and crossed the equator the forty-second day out. The
“ Dragon’' took the new route3 crossed the equatur the thirty-fourth day ; and had passed the parallel os Rio
de J aneiro in 230 S., before the “ Saratoga” had reached the line3 thus making a gain of 1‚500 miles upon
her competitor, with a saving that far os ten days or two weeks on the passage.

Thus the importance of the undertaking to collect and embody the experience os every navigator as 1ο
the winds and current-s os the sea, and so 10 present the results of all this information, that each may have the

benefit os the experience of all, is brought home to our merchants ; they reap benefits from it daily. Encourage·

ment is therefore given sor the vigorous prosecution os the work.
