have nobly stepped forward, and volunteered to co·operate with me in collecting facts for the further prosecu-

tion of the work. More than a thousand ships 313 now daily 3311 hourly occupied in all parts of the ocean in

making and recording, each a⁷ prescribed series of observations upon the winds and the currents, the rains, the
031138, 1113 81011118, 1113 thunder and the lightning3-the fogS, and 0103118, and drist—the temperature of the air
and water3 and all other subjects and objecta, facts and phe-nomena, which 313 of interest to navigation and

to science. By a recent order of the Βο3111 of Admiralty 3180, every captain and master in the English navy

are required to keep a “ 'macla Chart’' of the ship.

Enough of “ Abstract Logs” has already been collected at this office to make upwards of two hundred
large manuscript volumes, averaging each from two to three thousand days’ observationS, and the number is
003813311)1 increasingg indeed, the materials increase faster than 1 have force to 11180388 them.

When we travel 031 upon the ' ocean, and get beyond the influence of the land upon the windS, we find
,ourselves in a field particularly favorable for studying the general laws of atmospherical circulation.

Here, beyond the reach of the great equatorial and polar currents of the sea, there are no unduly heated
surfaceS, no mountain tanges, or other obstructions to the circulation of the atmosphere; nothing to disturb it
in its 1131313] 0031838. The sea, therefore, is the field sor observing the operations of the general laws which
govern its circulation. Observations on the land will enable 38 toto discover the exception& But from the sea

we shall get the rule. Each valley, every mountain range and local district, may 113 83111 10 have 118 own
γ peculiar system of 031138, winda, 13138, 3311 droughts. But not so the surface of the broad ocean.
In this connexion I beg leave to call the attention of meteorologists on shore to the importance of intro-

ducing a special column in their journaIS, to show what are the rainy winds at each station, and for each
S

season of the year.

Upon every water-shed which is drained into the sea, the precipitation may be considered 38 greater than
the evaporation for the whole extent of the shed 80 drained, by the amount of water which runs off into the
sea. In this view, all rivers may be regarded as immense rain gauges; and the volume of water annually dis·
charged by any one, 38 33 expression of the quantity which is annually evaporated from the sea, carried back
by the winda, 3ηά precipitated throughout the whole extent of the valley that is ,drained by it. Now, if we
knew the rain winds from the dry, sor each locality 3ηά 8338011 generally throughout such a basin, we should be
enabled 10 determine, with some degree of probability at least, as to the part of the ocean from which such
rains were evaporated. And thus, notwithstanding all the eddies caused by mountain chains, and other uneven
surfaceS, we might detect the general course of the atmospherical circulation over the land as well as the sea,
and make the general courses of circulation in each valley as obvious to the mind os the philosopher as is the
current of the Mississippi, or of any other great river, to his senses. · That river so 3110113118 with 31111138, that
it 18 difficult to tell by regarding small portions of its sur-sace only, which way the water 18 flowing· But when
. we come 10 regard the drift wood and the whole river, we are left in no doubt as to the onward course of the
main stream itself, with all its eddies and whirlpools.

These investigations asto the winds at sea indicate that the vapors which supply the sources of the Amazon
with rain, are taken up from the Atlantic ocean by the N. E. and S. E. trade windS.
