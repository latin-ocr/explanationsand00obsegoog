“ Somnusss‘r Housn, May, 1852.
‘⁴ Suu—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March the 4th, transmitting, by

direction of the Earl of Malmesbury, several documents received from foreign governments in reply to a pro-
posal made to them by Her Majesty’s Government, for their co-operation in establishing a uniform system of
recording meteorological observations, and requesting the opinion of the President and Council of the Royal

Society in reference to a proposition which has been made by the Government of the United StateS, respecting

the manner in which the proposed ¹co-ope1·ation should be carried out.

am directed to convey to you the following reply.

generally, and to the encouragement and support to be given to them by the governments of different countrieS,
the President and Council are of opinion that they are highly deserving of such consideration, not only for
their scientific value, but also on account of the important bearing which correct climatological knowledge has
on the welfare and material interests of the people of every country. ⁶

“ With reference to the proposal for the establishment of a uniform plan in respect to the instruments and

modes of observation, the President and Council are not of opinion that any practica] advantage is likely to
be obtained by pressing such a proposition in the present state of meteorological science. Most of the prin-

cipal governments of the European Continent, as Russia, Prussia, Austria, Bavaria and Belgium, have already
organized establishments for climatological researches in their respective stateS, and have placed them under

the superintendence of men eminently qualified by theoretical and practical knowledge, and whose previous

publications had obtained for them a general European reputation. Such men are Kupffer, Dove, Kriel, Lamont

and Querelet3 under whose direction the meteorological observations in the above-named countries are pro-
ceeding3 the instruments have been constructed under their care, and the instructions drawn up and published
by them under the sanction of their respective governments. The observations as they are made are sent to

them, are reduced and co-ordinated under their superintendence‚ and are published at the expense of the
