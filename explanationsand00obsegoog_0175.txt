without bottom, and we succeeded in getting, by one of the Syx's sels-registering thermometers, (which came
up uninjured by the immense pressure,) the temperature at that great depth, which was 490, while at the sur-

face it was 770.

On 18th May, at 9 A. M.‚ in latitude 300 6' North, longitude 670 56’ West, found a surface current of
one-third knot, setting N. W. by N., and a very slight under current (at 126 fathoms) not more than one-sixth
knot, setting N. Ε. No current was felt by the vessel during that day, but during the preceding night one·
fourth knot per hour, setting N. W. Being calm and pretty smooth, we sounded during this day to the depth
of 2,050 fathomS, when the wire broke without reaching bottom. The temperature at sursace 700, at 100

fathoms 650. The trial of currents on this day was one of the two occasions which 1 have alluded to, on

which we found a less under current than that above it.

On 29th May, at 11 Α. Μ., in latitude 330 ὃ9’ Ν., longitude 720 W„ found the surface current one-third
knot, setting S. E„ and an under current (at 126 fathoms) osone knot, setting W. N. W.; temperature at
surface 710, at 50 sathoms 70.5, at 100 fathoms 670( We were set during this day, as determined by the

asternoon observations‚ to the eastward, at the rate of one-half knot per hour. On this, which happened to be
the last occasion of these experimentS, I tried the current at the depth to which the kettle was lowered (80
fathomS,) which it would have been better to have always done; 1 found it tended in the same direction as that
at 126 fathomS, (counter to the surface current,) but at so small a rate that it could hardly be measured, not
more than ἡ knot per hour, the float moving at only this small rate, being but one-tenth of the velocity at
which it had moved just before when trying at 126 fathoms. This indicates that the kettle had just penetrated
the under current; and thus, by this means, rt would appear practicable to measure the depth of the surface
current, or its point os contact with the counter under current. Such experiments in the Gulf Str-eam would
be particularly interesting.

In connection with this subject of under currents, or abutar-ine streame, Ι may hope that you will find our
record of the temperatures of the ocean, taken, according to instructionS, at every 30 miles, to the depths of
100 and of 50 fathoms, and the surface temperatures taken every hour, may serve to throw more light in this
new world ofresearch, of such great interest and importance in terrestrial physics.

'l'he column of currents in the abstract log, gives the currents of practical importance to navigation‚ those
of the suffoca for every eight hours‚ or as osten as ascertained by the observations; the difference between the
true position, as determined by them, and that deduced from the log or dead-reckoning, being held as the effect
of current. Our dead-rechoning was with this view kept with unusual care and nicety. I found the night
observations could not be depended upon sufficiently to determine currents‚ but the early morning or evening
twilight often afforded beautiful opportunities—the horizon so well defined, and the larger planets and stars so
clear and brilliant. You will notice we met with the usual variable currents in crossing the North Atlantic in
about latitude 310, region of variable winds: between the longitudes, however, of 480 and 570 we met with a
steady current of about one knot an bour, setting to the northward and westward. Recrossing, in about latitude

170, we experienced {2}in the great equatoriol stream [setting to the westward, at the average of half a knot
