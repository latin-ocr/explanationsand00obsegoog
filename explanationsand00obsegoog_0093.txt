Oxygen, philosophers now say, composes one-fifth part of the atmosphere, and is magnetic. ‘

The discovery that the oxygen os the atmosphere is magnetic, presents itself to the mind as a great
physical fact, which perhaps is to serve as the keystone for some of the most grapd among the sublime and
beautiful structures which philosophy is erecting sor monuments to the genius os the age.

The facts elicited from the Wind and Current Charts had, basore 1 was aware of Faraday’s discoverieS‚

pointed me to the work of some agent whose office in the grand system of attnospherical circulation was

neither understood nor recognised.

In following these facts to their legitimate conclusionS, and in studying anthe phenomena that these charts
have successfully revealed touching the grand system of the distribution of moisture and the circdlation of the

atmosphere over the surface of the earth, 1 have often been induced to suspect that some other agent besides
heat and the rotation of the earth on its axiS, was concerned in creating the currents of the sea as well as the
currents os the atmosphere..

Never suspecting the character of this agent sor the atmosphere, its foot printS, at least, have at last been de·
tected 3 and there is reason to suppose tha't Faraday has discovered its lun-king place to be in the oxygen of the
atmosphere. Can there be in the oxygen of the water, too, a magnetic force capable os influcncing the currents
os the sea?

These charts' had enabled me to trace from the belt of calms, near the tropic of Cancer, which extends
entirely across the seaS, an efflux of air both to the North and to the South3 from the South side of this belt
the air flows in a never-ceasing breeze, called the N. E. trade winds, towards the equator.

On the North side of it, the prevailing winds come srom it also; but they go towards the N. Ε. They
are the well known southwesterly winds which prevail along the route srom this country to England in the
ratio os two to one.

Now these last named winds are going from a warmer to a colder climate 3 and therefore it may be sup-
posed that nature exacts from them what we know she exacts stom the air under similar circumstances, but
on a smaller scale before our eyes, viz ε more precipitation than evaporation.

Where then does the vapor, which these winds carry along, come from? was one of the questions sug-
gested by the chartS.

They afford grounds for the supposition that the air of which the N. Ε. trade winds are composed‚ and

which comes out of the same zone of calms, as do these southwesterly windS, so far from being saturated with

vapor at its exoduS, is dry 3-the N. Ε. trade winds are sor the most part dry winds 3—reason suggests, and
philosophy tear-hes, that going from a lower to a higher temperature the evaporating powers of these winds are
increased: that they have to travel in their oblique course, towards the equator, a distance of nearly 3‚ooo
miles; that as a general rule they evaporate all the time, and all the way, and precipitate little or none on

their route3 investigations have proven that they are not saturated with moisture until they have arx-‘wad 50le

up to the regions of equatorial calms‚ azone of constant precipitation.

This calm zone of Cancer borders also, it was perceived, upon a rainy region.
