No further disturbance took place until noon of the 5th, when we were somewhat startled by the familiar
and unmistakable sound of ice grinding against the side os the ship. Going on deck, Ι perceived that an·

other crack had taken place along the length of the vessel. It did not open more than a foot3 this, however,

was sufficient to liberate the vessel, and she rose several inches bodily, having become more buoyant since she

was frozen in. The following day, in the evening, the crack opened several yardS, leaving the sides of the
Advance entirely free, and she was once more supported by, 3ηά rode in her own element. We were not, how·
ever, by any means in a pleasant situation. The floes were considerably broken in all directions around us, and
one crack had taken place between the two vesseIS. The Rescue was not disturbed in her bed of ice.

December 7, at 8 a m., the crack in which we were had opened and formed a lane of water 50 feet wide,
communicating abead, at the distance of 60 feet, with ice of about one foot in thickness, which had formed
since the 3d. The vessel was secured to the largest floe near us, (that on which our spare stores wera depos-
ited.) At noon the ice was again in motion, and began to close, affording us the pleasant prospect of an in-
evitable “ nip'' between two floes of the heaviest kind. In a short time the prominent points took our sides
on the starboard, just about the main rigging, and on the port, under the counter, and at the fore rigging, thus
bringing three points of pressure in such a position that it must have proved fatal to a larger or less strength·
ened vessel.

The Advance, however, stood it bravely. After trembling and groaning in every joint, the ice passed
under and raised her about two and a half feet ; she was let down again for a moment, 3ηά then her stern was
raised about five feet; her bow, being unsupported, was depressed almost as much. In this uncomfortable
position we remained. The wind blew a gale from the eastward3 and the ice all round was in dreadful com·
motion, excepting, fortunate-ly, that in immediate contact with us. The commotion in the ice continued all
through the night, and we were in momentary expectation oswitnessing the destruction of both vessels. The
easterly gale had set in some two or three miles to the west. ““

As soon as it was light enough to see on the 9th, it was discovered that the heavy ice in which the Res·
cue had been embedded for so long a time, was entirely broken up 3ηά piled around her in massive hummocks.
On her pumps being sounded, 1 was gratified to learn that she remained tight‚ notwithstanding the immense
straining and pressure that she must have endured.

During this period of trial, as well as in all former and subsequent ones, I could not avoid being struck
with the calmness and decision of the office-rs, as well as the subordination and good conduct of the men,

without an exception. Each one knew the imminence of the peril that surrounded us, and was prepared to

abide it with a stout beart. There was no noise, no confusion. 1 did not detect, even in the moments when

the destruction of the vessels seemed inevitable, a single desponding look among the whole crew3 on the con
trary, each one seemed resolved to do his whole duty, and everything went on cheerily and bravely.

For my own part Ι had become quite an invalid—so much so, as to prevent my taking an active part in
the duties of the vessel, as Ι had always done, or even from incurring tha exposure necessary to proper exer·

eise. However, 1 feltssrbo apprehension that the vessel would not be properly taken care of, for I bad perfect
