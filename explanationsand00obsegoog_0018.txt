⁶ “ We have hitherto dealt with the sea and air‚—-the one the medium through which the commerce of al}
nations is transported, the other the means by which it is moved along,—-as themselves the great vehicles of
moisture, heat3 and cold, throughout the regions of the world—the means of securing the interchange of these
inestimable commoditie8‚ so that excess may be removed to where deficiency existS, deficiency substituted sor
exceSS‚ t'o the unbounded advantage of all. We have selected this group of illustrations for our viem, bc-

cause they are the most obviouS, the most simple and the most intelligible and beautiful, that could be chosen.

Short as our space is, and largely as it has already been trenched upon, we must not confine oursclves to these.

“ We have already said that the atmosphere forms a spherical shell, surrounding the earth to a depth
which is unknown to ηε, by reason of its growing tenuity, as it is released from the pressure os its own super-
incumbent maSS. Its upper surface cannot be nearer to us than fifty, and can scarcely be more remote than

five hundred miles· 1t surrounds us on all sideS, yet we see it not3 it presses on us with a load of fifteen

pounds on every square inch os surfacc of our bodieS, or from seventy to one hundred tons on us in all, yet wc
do not so much as feel its weight. Softer than the finest down—-morc impalpable than the finest gossamer,—·
it leaves the cobweb undisturbed, and scarcely stirs the lightcst flower that feeds on the dew it supplies ; yet it
bears the fleets of nations on its wings around the world, and crushes the most refractory substances with ‚its
weight. When in motion, its force is sufficient to level the most stately 'forest8‚ and stable buildings, with the⁹
Barth—to raise the waters of the ocean into ridges like mountainS, and dash the strongest ships to pieces like
toys. It warms and cools by turns the Earth and the living creatures that inhabit it. It draws up vapors
from the sea and land, retains them dissolved in itsclf‚ or suspended in cisterns of cloudS,‘and throws then}
down again as rain or dew, when they are required. It bends the rays of the sun from their path, to gite us
the twilight of evening and of dawn—it disperses and refracts ψείι· various tints to beautisy the approach and
the retreat of the orb of day. But for the atmosphere, sunshine would burst on us and sail us at once—and at
'once remove us from midnight darkness to the blaze of noon. We should have no twilight to soften and beau-
tify the landscapc——no clouds to shade us from the scorching beat, but the bald earth as it revolved on its
axis, would turn its tanned and weakencd front to the full and unmitigated rays of the lord of day. It affords
the gas which vivifies and warms our frame8‚ and receives into itsclf that which has been polluted by use, and
is thrown off as noxiouS. It feeds the flame of life exactly as it does that of the fire,—-it is in both cases con·-
named, and affords the sood of consumption—in both cases it becomes combined with charcoal, which requires
it sor combustion, and is removed by it when this is over. ‘ It is only the girdling encircling air,' says a writer
ν in the North British Review, ‘that flows above and around all that makes the whole world kin. The carbonic
aeid with which to·day our breathing fills the air, to·morrow seeks its way round the world. The date trees
that grow round the falls of the Nile will drink it in by their leaves; the cedars os Lebanon will take of it to add
to their stature3 the cocoanuts of Tahiti will grow rapidly upon it; and the palms and bananas of J apan, will

change it into flowerS. The oxygen we are breathing was distilled for us some short time ago by the magno-
lias of the Susquehanna, and the great trees that skirt the Orinoco and the Amazon—the giant rhododendrons

of the Himalayas contributed to it, and the roses and myrtles of Cashmere, the Cinnamon tree of Ceylon‚ and
