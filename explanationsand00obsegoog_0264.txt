this· little or nothing was known with regard to it. But since the appearance of that paper, attention has been
very much directed to the Gulf Stream.† The Coast Survey has been at work upon it, and the information
collected by that establishment and the officers of the navy, with regard to it, added to that afforded by these
charts may be said to exceed in philosophical extent and value all that was previously known about it.

These investigations confirm, to a remarkable extent, the speculations put sort'n in that paper3 they have

converted many of the suggestions of theory into philosophical factS, and given increased importance to the

views which l had the honor to present in 1844.

In the paper which, as already mentioned, was read before the National Institute 8 years agO, and repeated,
by request, before the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists the same year, it was reinarked
with regard to the Gulf Stream and its counter current, the icc—bearing current from the North :—

“ The Guls Stream, as it issues from the Straits of Florida, is of a dark indigo blue3 the line of junction
between it and the ‘ roily’ green waters of the Atlantic, is plainly seen for hundreds of mileS. 'I‘hough this
line is finally lost to the eye as the stream goes North, it is preserved to the thermorneter sor several thousand
miles3 yet to this day the limits of the Gulf Stream, even in the most frequented parts of the ocean, though

so plainly marked, are but vaguely described on our chartS. Thousands of vessels cross it every year ; many of

⁴² ‘⁴ Upon a correct knowledge of the force and set of currents in the ocean, osten depende not only the safety of vessel and cai-go,

but the lives all on board3 and, owing to the want os this knowledge, hundreda of vessels, thousands of persons, and millions of

property are annually cast away or lost at sea.
“ 1 do not intend to occupy the time of members with a recapitulation here of what we do know with regard to ocean currents 3 that

indeed might soon be told 3 for we know little or nothing of them, except that they are to be met with here and there at sea, many of
them sometimes going one way and sometimes another 3 and that the waters of some of them are colder and os others warmer than the

teas in which they are found. That we should have a better knowledge of them, and of the laws which govern them, is not only an
important matter to those who follow the sea, or make ventures abroad, but it is also a matter of exceeding interest to all those whose
erilarged philanthropy, or ennobling sentimenta, prompt in them a desire to diffuse knowledge among their follows, orin any manner to
benetit the human race. The mere fact that this meeting is held at all, is evidence ample and complete that it is composed altogether os

such. 1 therefore submit itas a question sor the consideration of the meeting, whether it be not competent for the National Institute to -

devise and set on soot a plan for multiplying observations and extending our information upon these interesting phenomena. A subject
of vast importance in the business of commerce and navigation, the currente of the ocean seem to me to be altogether worthy the attention
of this society—a series of well conducted observatione upon thern would be in perfect unison with the great objecta ot' uset‘ulness for
which it was created and now exista, and for which its distinguished members and guests have been invited, and are here asseriibled from
all parts os the country.

⁴⁸ Before such an assemblage os mind and intelligence, it is necesisary only to mention the meagre state of our information, even with
regard to that great anomaly os the ocean, the Guls Strearn 3 and there will be—there can be, but one mind, asto the importance of making
further observatione, and of multiplying facts with regard to it. ln simply reminding the society, that all we know of this wonderful phe·
nomenon is contained chiefly in what Doctor Franklin said of it more than 50 years ago, that his facts were collected by chance as itwere
and his observatione made with but few of the facilities which navigatore now have, 1 seel that enough and ull has been done that is
necessary to be done, in order to impress the Institute with the importunes of further observatione upon it.'' 0 ⁰ ‘ ⁶ ⁸

ΐ“ Linked thus with other geological agents, the currents of the sea cannot fait to present themselves to the mind ot the ge-›logist as
important and interesting subjecte sor investigation. How much more so are they in the eyes os the navigator 3 with him, the source os
this coast current is a matter of conjecture, and its cause a mystery. And us to its strength, its fluctuatione, and the laws which govern
thern, his nautical books are all but silent. Nor has the history of navigation recorded the first series of systematic observationis upon it.

‘⁸ Proceeding further into the Atlantis, we sind a vast stream of warm water running counter to this. Itis the Gutf Streani bound from
the Simit- of Florida to the Banks of N ewt'oundland, and thence to the shores of Europe. What its breadth or its depth may be, we
know not. We are told indeed that even at the same place it runs sometimes at the rate of two knots the bour, sometimes at five, und we

know that it may always be found within certain broad limits, varying in this too at the same place, from 140 to 3⁴0 miles. With this
