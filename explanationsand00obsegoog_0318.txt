1 have the promise of several Captains (who are now out) to get for you a small piece os the skin of either

right or sperm whale.

As the Bowlzead Right Whale differs in form and spouts from all other whales known, Ι forward 3 sketch
or diagram‚ showing their appearance as they lay swimming, and the form of the spoutS. Also the shape (as
developed) of that part which differs from the common kind when dead and on the surface.

The skin of the Bowhead· is entirely smooth, of very dark color, with the single exception of two white
hunches‚ each the size os an ostrich egg, forming the spout-bole.

1 learn from Captains that the sea around where bowheads 313 found, is covered with parts of dead fish,

and they suppose they were discharged from the whaleS.

The horn whale‚ or unicorn whale is smaller than the right whale. The horn whale‚ when full grown, is
about 10 feet long; it projects abead from the upper lip—is of solid bone—appears as if used 'ny the whale
for rooting out food from the bottom of the sea—probably 3 spec-ies of the war whale. Capt. Smith thinks they
may prove to be the California Grey Whale. There is 3 marked difference between the Russian or Came]
backed whale and the common right whale. The spout of the former is 3 perpendicular jet, running high and

then branching off in two partS, one part falling over *the head, the other continuing upwards until its force is

spent, then falls towards the tail. The spout os the right whale is a low, bushy jet, flying in all directions.
The Russian whale has 3 hump on the back from the centre of which 113 spoutS. Immediately behind this

hump, the back caves in. His tail is broad and nearly square. The right whale is smoother on the back and
has 3 nari-ow tail.”
