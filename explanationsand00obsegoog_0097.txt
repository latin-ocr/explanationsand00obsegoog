But I saw reasons for supposing that what came to the equatorial calms as the N. Ε. trade winds, continued
to the South as an upper current ; and that what had come to the same zone as S. E. trade winds, ascended
and continued over into the northern hemisphere as an upper current, bound sor the calm zone of Cancer.

And these are the principal reasons upon which this supposition was based:

At the seasons of the year when the Sun is evaporating most rapidly in the southern hemisphere, the most

· rain is falling in the northern. Therefore 1 supposed that much of the vapor which is taken up there is pre·

cipitated here.

The evaporating surface in the southern hemisphere is greater, much greater, than that in the northern t ·
still all the great rivers are in the northern hemisphere z—the Amazon being regarded as common to both.
And this, as far as it goes, is corroborative o! the above.

Independently of other sources os information, the charta-taught me to believe that the mean temperatura
of the tropical regions was higher in the northern than in the southern hemisphere; for they show that the
difference is such as to draw the equatorial edge of the S. Ε. trades far over on this side of the equatur, and
to give them force enough to keep the N. Ε. trade winds out of the southern hemisphere almost entirely.

Consequently, as before stated, the S. Ε. trade winds being in contact with a more extended evaporating
surface, and continuing in contact with it for a longer time, or through a greater distance, they would probably
arrive at the trade wind place of meeting, more heavily laden with moisture than the others.

Taking the laws and rates of evaporation into consideration, 1 could find no part of the ocean οἱ the
northern hemisphere from which, according to theindications· of the charte, the sources of the Mississippi, the
St. Lawrence, and the· other great rivers of our hemisphere could be supplied.

It appeared to me, therefore, that the extra-tropica} regions os the northern hemisphere stood in the

relation os a condenser to a grand steam machine, the boiler of which was in the region «ff the S. Ε. trade
winds; and that the trade winds of this hemisphere performed the like office for the regions beyond capricorn.

The calm zone of capricorn is the duplicate of that of Cancer, and the winds flow from it as they do
from that: both North and South: with this difference‚ that on the polar side of the capricorn belt, they prevail
from the N. W., instead of the S. W. ς and on ὡρεςιιαῐοήε] side from the S. Ε. instead of N. Ε.

Now, if it were so, that the vapor of the N. Ε. trade winds were condensed in the extra-tropical regions
of the southern hemisphere, the following path, on account of the effect of diurnal rotation of the earth upon the
course of the winds, would represent the mean circuit os a portion of the atmosphere moving according to the
general system of its circulation over the Pacific odean, viz z coming down from the North as an upper current,
and appearing on the sursace of the earth in about longitude 1300 W., and near the tropic of Cancer, it would
here commeuce to blow the N. E, trade winds of that region. '

Its course would be towards the equator, somewhat in the direction of the King’s Mill group of Islands.
Meeting no land in this long oblique track over the tepid waters of a tropical sea, it would, somewhere to the
Επεὶ of these Islands, ar‘rive at the belt of equatorial calms, which always divides the N. Ε. from the S. Ε.
