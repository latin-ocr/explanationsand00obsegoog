Besides the practical advantages which it is conjectured will inure to the whaling interest from these in·
vestigationS, much”information os a highly interesting character will probably be elicited by them for the natu·
ralist and geologist.

Scenes and information how interesting so ever to the world at large they may be, yet by often recurring,

lose their novelty to classes3 they become familiar, cease to strike, and are at best apt to be thought not worth
speaking or writing about. This is particularly the case with regard to the wbalemen and their calling.

With the view of reminding them how little is known by the world generally, with regard to the habits of
the whale, it may be remarked that the information conveyed in the communications from them, which are
now published and which information has been obtained from them by accident or chance as it were, will be
read with much interest by men of science. Ι

The gentlemen who were kind enough to furnish this information‚ had, I am sure, no idea of its publica·
tion ; but I hope they will excuse the liberty for the sake of the motive.

These papers will, it is hoped, be the means of calling forth much additional information of a kindred nature.

Letters- from Whalemen.

“Herewith I foi-ward some additional knowledge of the sperm whole, their history, habit3‚food, age,

διο. ; also the laws that govern their migratory movements, with such other thoughts as may occur to memory
as 1 write.

The sperm whale, though found in every sea and elimet, yet their great nursery is in the great Pacific3
their haunts are found there from coast to coast3 their limits that of the ocean itself. The males are more

frequently found in high latitudeS, the other sex in milder climate83 a tropical region seems to suit them best:

they seek bays in islands and coral beds and reefS in vast shoals to bring forth their young. The period of
gestation I do not know. Perhaps no animal found in the sea are more timid and easier frightened3 they
alway group by themselveS, and seem to shun the society of other tribes of the ocean.

Their powers of vision are exceedingly limited, they cannot see directly ahead of them ; hence they often
when alarmed, run foul of each other, and foul of other objectS. I have seen them run against a whale boat,
and the concussion so alarm them as to create the most convulsive phrenzy3 and Ι think they are as unconscious
of the approach of the harpooner from that direction as when he follows after them. Their exquisite sense of
hearing, however, is most extraordinary3 not unfrequently in large shoals covering miles of space, the instant
one is attacked, the whole school for miles around spring, shoot out their heads above water, and listen for a
moment, and if the attack is made on a female (or cow) they will all rush with great speed to their wounded
companion, as if to extend their sympathy‚ if nothing more, unconscious of their own danger. The bold whaler
avails himself of their approach, lays off a short distance from his bleeding victim‚ and takes them as they

come3 and if he is clevet at the deadly game, he will mortally wound several, ere they discover the tragic act
