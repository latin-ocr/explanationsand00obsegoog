and this insight is sufficient to enable us to perceive that exquisite indeed are the arrangements which nat
has provided for supplying this calm belt with heat, and for pushing the snow line there, high up above

cloudS, in order that the atmosphere may have room to expand‚ to rise up, overflow, and course back into

channels of its circulation. As the vapor is condensed and formed into drops of rain, a two-sold objec‘
accomplished z coming from the cooler regions of the cloudS, the rain drops are cooler than the air and ea
below. They descend, and by absorption· take up the heat which has been accumulating in the earth's cr
during the dry season, and which cannot now escape by radiation. Thus this cloud-ring modifies the clim:
of all places beneath it; over-shadowing at different seasons all parallels from 50 S. to 150 N.

In the process os condensation, these rain drops on the other hand have set free a vast quantity of lat(
heat, which has been gathered up with the vapor from the sea by the trade winds and brought hither. T
caloric thus liberated is taken by the air and carried up aloft still further to keep, at the proper distance fr<
the Earth, the line of perpetual congelation. Were it possible to trace a thermal curve in the upper regions

* the air to represent this line, we should no doubt find it mounting sometimes at the equator, sometimes on tl
side, and sometimes on that, of it; but always so mounting as to overleap this cloud-ring. This thermal li1
would not ascend always over the same paralleIS, it would ascend over those between which this ring happe1
to be; and the distance of this ring from the equator is regulated according to the seasonS.

If we imagine the atmospherical equator to be always where the calm belt is which separatas the N. 1
from the S. E. trade windS, then the loop in the thermal curve which should represent the line of perpetu:
congelation insthe air would be always found to stride this equator, and it may be supposed that athe
mometer kept sliding on the surface of the earth so as always to be in the middle of this rain belt, would she·
very nearly the same temperature all the year round3 and so too would a barometer, the same pressure.

Returning and taking up the train of contemplation as to the office which this belt of cloudS, as ;
encircles the earth, performs in the system of cosmical arrangements, we may see that the cloud-ring an
calm zone which it overshadows perform the office both of ventricle and auricle in the immense atmospherica
heart, where the heat and the forces which give vitality and power to the system are brought into play-
where dynamical strength is gathered, and an impulse given to the air, sufficient to send it thence throug]
its long and tortuous channels of circulation.

Thus, this ring, or band, or belt of clouds, is stretched around our planet to regulate the quantity of pre
cipitation in the rain belt beneath it; to preserve the due quantum of heat on the face of the Earth3 ί(
adjust the winds3 and send out for distribution to the four cornerS, vapors in proper quantities to make up t‹
each river basin, climate and season its due quota of sunshine, cloud and moisture. Like the balance-whee]
of a well constructed chronometer, this cloud-ring affords the grand atmospherical machine the most exquisitel)
arranged sels-compensation. If the Sun fail in his supply of heat to this region, more of its vapors are con·
densed‚ and heat is discharged from its latent store-houses in quantities just sufficient to keep the machine in

ὼε most perfect compensation. If on the other hand, too much beat be found to accompany the rays of the

as they impinge upon the upper circumference of this belt, then again on that side are the means of self-
