the acquirements of any officer of EngineerS, and that shall enable him without difficulty to take measures for

a due record being kept, of every matter required, and, at the same time, not⁸ call upon any exertions or

perfect manner.
“ ‘He requests an early communication from the Commanding Royal Engineers of the first measures taken by

From the Appendioe to the same.
“ Foru-:rou Ornos, April 30, 1851.

Sm :—1 transmit to you copies of a letter, with its enclosure8‚ which I have received from Colonel Reid,
of the Royal Engineer8‚ who for many years has devoted his attention to the theory os stormS, and whose
object has been to investigate, with a view to practica] use in' navigation, the laws by which storms and variable
winds are governed.

In order that an investigation of this nature may be practically useful, it is essential that facts connected
with the atmospherical phenomena in question should be carefully observed and accurately recorded over as
large a portion as possible of the surface of the globe by persons of educatinn, and whose scientific attain-
ments or professional avocations qualify them for making such observations.

Colonel Reid has suggested that such observations could be most easily made and recorded by captains

of portS, masters of light-houseS, harbor masterS, and other8‚ whose professional pursuits naturally lead them

to be constant obser-vers of atmospherical phenomena.

The enclosures in Colonel Reid's letter will mo‘re fully point *out the manner in which information on the
subject of' storms may be collected.

1 have accordingly to instruct you to use your best endeavors to procure such inforrnation on this important
subject3 and you will transmit to me half yearly an abstract of the information you may have obtained, with
such remarks as may suggest themselves to you. If you can add diagrams to show the tracks of any remark·
able stormS, it would greatly add to the value of your reports. As it is of importance to circulate as widely

as possible information as to storm trackS, you should encourage the publication of such information in news·

papers and periodical workS.

1 am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

(Signed) PALMERSTON.
