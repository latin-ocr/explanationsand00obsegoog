tions elaborated out of the fact, that there is a surface current known to be setting through the Straits of Ba

mandeb into the Red sea. Other observations, 1 had none.

1 have attempted on divers occasions to show theoretically, hou the sursace of the Red sea must in ι
sequence of evaporatione, be higher at the Straits of Babelmandeb than at the Isthmus of Suez; how it
sents an inclined plane to the northwest3 how the water in this sea, aster it has supplied the demands for v:
(which is fresh, not salt‚) is salter, and therefore beavier than that which is just entering to meet those

mands; and how therefore the beavier and salter water must escape as an under current through the Str:

os Babelmandeb into the open ocean.
I have within a few days past received volume IX, Transactions of the Bombay Geographical Socic

from May, 1849, to August, 1850. From it, I learn that the excellent society of which it is the orgari,
especially included in its field os researches, “the determination os the saltness of the ocean, and of the ar
and gulss of the sea.”

At p. 38 et seq., of that vol., is a paper by Dr. Buist on the “saltness of the Red sea.” That paper ft
sustains the position which has already been advanced during these investigatione. It contains so much tl
is valuable upon the subject, being for the most part the result of actual observation, that Ῑ take the liberty
extracting quite freely from it.

“,Mn Mortis, chief Engineer of the Ajdaha, had some time ago taken the more certain method of filli1
a succession of bottles full of water all the way from Suez to Bombay, and these having been placed in t
hands of Dr. Giraud, whose assistance, valuable at all times, became doubly valuable from the promptitud
cheerfulness and alaerit-y, with which it was rendered, had found the following to be the results: they we

unexpccted, but there was no reason to doubt their accur-acy :—

“ Dr. Giraud gives the following note of the saltness of the sea, from a variety of other localities. Fron
this it will be seen, that the Mediterranean at Marseilles is os the same saltness as the Red sea at διιεῖ, while
the Atlantic in the latitude of the Canaries is few more salt.
