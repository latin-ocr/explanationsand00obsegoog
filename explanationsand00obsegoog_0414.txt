satisfaction‚ and am wel] satisfied on· my own part that the western route is sar the best, and have for several

years recommended it to be taken, and Ι am happy to say 1 have been since told by many that it is the most · ·
preferable. ,

Ι sailed from Newport‚ R. 1., J uly 3d, 1836, in the Schooner “ Sailor’s Return”——myself master—bound
to the Falkland Islands and South ShetlandS. The Schooner ‘⁴ Geneva,” Captain A. Padack‚ my consort‚
sailed the same day, and kept company with me until we arrived in the latitude of 40 N. and 250 West. The
winds were light and baffling from S. W. to S. S. W for one or two days. Ι stood to the westward, but he
began to worry for sear os falling to leeward. 1 left him, giving him instructions to proceed with all possible
dispatch, and meet me at the Falkland lslands ε we were then in 40 16¹ North, and 260 West, wind S. S. W.
The “ Geneva'’ stood on her eastern tack, Ῑ to the westward, and arrived at the Falkland Islands twenty-one
days before her. η

On examining our journal‚ Ι found I gained thirteen days of the time between 40 North and 80 South,
by nothing but his being afraid of falling to leeward; whilst Ι could lay the land along, he was continually
tacking about ; and as sor a current, I tried several timeS, and found but very little setting N. W. There was
the schooner “ Ann Howard‚” of New London, had the same passage as the “ Geneva,’‘ and took the same
route3 she had eighty-one days to the coast of Patagonia‚ and eighty-three to Port Desire‚ latitude 470 45’ S.
longitude 650 54¹ -W. The'A. H. sailed within one day of the Gene‘va, andarrived within two days of her,
giving me twenty days abead of one, and twenty-three ahead os the other. ’

“ Sailor’s Return,’' a second voyage, sailed 22d August, 1838; and in thirty days was cast away at Cape
St. Roque‚ standing along shore‘on the off-shore tacit, having made the land that morning. Ι was bound in
to Rio Grande North to repair my sheathing which had-started off the bottom. 1 crossed the line in 350 4b',
Ι found no trouble in getting up the coast, until I struck on the reef at Cape St. Roque.

I found the tides tolerably regular at the Cape during the few days I was on shore, and the pilots say the ·
currents are trifiing on the coast from St. Roque to St. Augustine, when you are in more than forty fathoms
water, and Ι believe it is true, for 1 have tried it si‘nce, and found very little, if any.

Schooner “ Benjamin De Wolf‚” W. H. Smyley, master, sailed from Newport‚ R. 1., for the Falkland
Islands, ad of April, 1839. Having a sharp vessel, and every confidence in my own mind of the western
route, Ι determined to steer my course as if bound to Fernando do Noronha, and to pay no attention either to
winda, weather or currentS, no more than if such was not to be found on the route. Ι found no calmS, and
but little rain. 1 passed inside of Fernando do Noronha, distant twelve or fifteen mileS, and passed Olinda in
twenty—one days and eight hourS, and from St. Augustine to Port Eginont, I had but twenty days—making
but forty·one days and eight hours passage to the Falklands.

Schooner “ Benjamin DeWolf,’' second voyage, W. H. Smyley, master, sailed from Newport‚ R. 1., 28th

May, 1840, for Patagonia, and arrived at Rio Negr0, latitude 410 4¹ S., longitude 620 49' W„ in forty·one
(1858, passing about fifty-five miles east of Fernando do Noronha, and crossing the Line in 360 15¹. 1 found

the wind from N. W to S. W„ more than from any other quarter, from the line to St. Roque. The current
