South of the calms ot'Capricorn, the winds are the same all round the world. Taking them on meridian of
the Cape of Good Hope, a fast ship may run with them to the eastward, averaging upwards of 200 miles a
day all the way round to Cape Horn.

Capt. McKay in his passage of 82 days in the “ Sovereign of the Seas,'' from the Sandwich Islands to
New York, carried the S. E. trades down to the parallel of 450 South. There he found the baffling winds
peculiar to the “ Horse Latitudes ;” after crossing the parallel of 480 he cleared this belt and took the famous
westerly winds which wafted him along so finely.

There is warm water—an Australian gulf stream—to be crossed or drifted along with, between Port
Philip and Cape Hom. In the paper on the Gulf Stream, which is referred to at p. 55 of this work, the exis-
tence of such a body of warm water was theoretically pointed out. The abstract log os the “ Sovereign of

the Seas” gives me practica] proof of its existence, as the following extract will show:

 

Here is a change of 190 in the temperature of the water in one day's run ; and from the parallel of 47 0
491 to that os 48⁰ 40‘, though the difference of latitude is less than one degree, the difference in the tempe·
rature of the water is 280 ! ⁶

1 shall not now stop to investigate the genesis of this warrn water and warin current ; suffice it for our
present purposes to say, il receives its warmth in the equatorial regions, but whether in the Indian ocean, or

in the torrid zone of the Pacific, it is immaterial for our present purposes. We know it comes from warmer
