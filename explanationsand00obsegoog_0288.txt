and during those ten days rain fell to the depth of &15 incheS, or at the rate of 18 feet and upwards during
the year.

This belt of calms vibrates up and down the ocean as the belts of the trade winds do. In the summer
months it is found between the parallels of 80 and 140 of North latitude, and in the spring between 50 S. and
40 N.

By this chart the navigator can tell what places within the range of this zone, have, during the year, two
rainy seasons, what one, and what are the rainy months for each locality.

Were the N. Ε. and the S. E. trades with the belt of equatorial calms of different colors and visible to
an astronomer in one of the planets, he might, by the motion of these belts or girdles alone, tell the seasons
with us.

He would see them at one season going North, then appearing stationary, and then commencing their
return to the South. But though he would observe that they follow the Sun in his annual course, he would
remark that they do not change their latitude, as much as the Sun does his declination ; he would therefore
discover that their extremes of declination are not so far asunder as the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn,
though in certain seasons the changes from day to day are very great. He would observe that these zones of
winds and calm have their tropics or stationary nodes, about which they linger near three months at a time ;
and that they pass from one of their tropics to the ⁸other in a little less than another three monthS. Thus he
would observe the whole system of belts to go North from the latter part of May till some time in August.
Then they would stop and remain stationary till winter, in December3 when again they would commence to
move rapidly' over the ocean, and down towards the South, until the last of February or the first of March ;
then again they would become stationary and remain about this, their southern tropic, till May again.

The zone of the S. E. trade winds would present to him its northern edge inclined somewhat to the equator;

commencing near the coast of Africa and tracing the usual outlines of this edge over towards South Amerina,
he would discover that it approached the equator at an angle of about 180 ; and our supposed astronomer would

announce that the equatorial edge of the zone os S. Ε. trades in the Atlantic is inclined towards the equator at
an angle of Ibo—that it lies W. 150 N ., and Ε. 15)0 S.

Turning his attention now to the belt of N. E. trade winds, he would observe the equatorial edge os this
zone to be somewhat, though not altogether, symmetrical with the equatorial edge of the S. E. trade wind zone
of the other hemisphere. On the African side it is farthest from the equator, which it approaches at an angle
of about 100 (W. by S.) until it reaches the meridian of abut 400 West. Here it is deflected to the North
and'trends off in the direction of W. N. W. Here we begin to experience the effect of the North American
continent upon the trade winds at sea. The rarefication caused by the lands of northern Texas and the arid
plains in that quarter, is sufficient in summer to convert the N. Ε. trades of the Gulf of Mexico into a pre·.
vailing wind from the southward and eastward.

⁶ , In the Pacific and within a certain distance from the land, the N. Ε. trade winds are, by the same influ-
ences, as these researches into the winds and currents of the sea have revealed, converted into a southerly

momon-
