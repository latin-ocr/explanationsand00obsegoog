did or did-net reach bottom3 still less that, if it did, the preeise time was between 11 A. M. and meridian—
though such is my belief, and that the depth was therefore between 3,000 and 3‚500 fathoms· Ther'e are still
difficulties about the several times noted near those meridian measures. Thus the surprising differences noted
of 19, 37, 53, and 28 minutes-—upon any theory, seem to be almost inexplicable. Much may be due to the effect
of the submarine current, the existence of which was proved, I think, by the drag of our line: For, whilst the

ship’s reckoning gave a surface drift, by current and other causes, of nearly one mile per hour, S. S. E.—for
the 24 hours which included our nine hours time, our boat was dragged at the rate of nearly, sometimes fully,
a knot and a half per honr, invariably towards the northward and westward whenever the line was checked.

As a speculation, therefore, rather than a, fact, 1 assume that the shot had lodged, at or near meridiam
the line passing through the two great oceanic strata, and forming with its long bight, a sort of figure S.-

which, as the under current was strongest, probably also thickest, would be gradually more‘and more, drawn

out in its lower loop ; that the line therefore would now be drawn out only to seed the two counter streams, ,

and that we might have thus continued indefinitely to expeud line without other result.

As we are reporting the ‚longest line yet got out, in sounding with the twine, 1 am anxious to fairly state
my doubts ; which perhaps are justified by the configuration of the Eastern shores of the Southern continent3
and a belief that no such vast depth as that -seemingly obtained, is due to this part of the Atlantic-

But 1 desire rather to present the facts than to insist upon the argument, and in these there are no sub·-
stantia] differences between myself and Mr. Glover. 1 hope he may present his views also in writing, that yon

may form your own conclusione on this remarkable sounding.
1 regretted after my first 1,000 fathoms were out that my sinker was not beavier, and having now more
confidence m the line, 1 shall make my next experiment with more weight. One hollow shot with the core

filled with lead will perhaps be better than two 321b.

as you directed, carefully corked and sealed, and thrown overboard at noon.’'
