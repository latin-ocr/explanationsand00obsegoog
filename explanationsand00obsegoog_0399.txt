at Valparaiso. Our passage from New York to Valpariaso was sixty·six days; from Valparaiso to San Fran·
cisco was §buy-two days—-nearly 311 1113 way light trades: S. E. and N. Ε.

“ Six days out from New York‚ broke off main topmast, and that in its sall took all three topgallant masts.
Soon after took a W. S. W. and West gale—run the ship dead before the sea and wind : 13 consequence of
this, crossed the equator 13 about longitude 280 30‘ W. in twenty-one days from New York. Losing top·
mast, we had no main topsail in the ship for 3133 dayS, 3ηά 30 topgallant 33113 for twelve days ; had we 301
met with this accident, Ι think we should have been down to the Line in sixteen days.

“ In latitude 40 N. the N. E. trades left us, 11133 baffling down to latitude 20 N. Then took the wind at
S. S. E. 3311 S. E„ until near the coast of Brazil, when the wind 11331εά 30 we did not have to make 3 tack;
presume had we crossed in longitude 300 W., we should have fetched along the coast.’'

This letter os Captain Richardson is quoted as 33 111331131103 of what 1 have endeavored to impress upon
navigatorS‚ with regard to their course, after crossing the Line well to the westward, aud when it appears 10
be touch-and·go as to clearing St. Roqne, viz ι 313311 boldly on, and take advantage of slants 3311 short legs,
10 make long 0333.

1 received the abstract of another vessel about the same time that crossed in 310, 3311 1 notice in the re·
marks after crossing the 1133-“ back strapped”—-“ no chance of weathering Cape St. Roque”—“shall evi-
dently fall to leeward,'’ “ bad luck‚’' 810. Yet this desponding navigator stood bodily 03, took advantage of
a 31331, 310011 off sor eight hours‚ went passed St. Roque like a shot, and the thirty-second day out from New
York, crossed the parallel of Rio.

During the last year (1851) 1113 average passage to Rio of the ships that have used the charts, has been
about³5 days, showing a clear gain upon the old route of nearly three weeks.

That vessels will sometimes meet with unfavorable winds by this as they will by all 103133, 1 need but
quote as 33 111331131103 1113 Log-book of the batque “ Mermaid,'’ bound from Boston to San FranciscO, May,
1851.

It will be observed that that vessel did not get the N. Ε. 1131133 31 311, except for 033 day ; and that not·
withstanding, that after reaching the region where she ought to have found 1113 N. Ε. 1131133, 3113 found the
winds sor the most part south of east, yet she 11311 30 difficulty in crossing the Line 13 300 ; 3311 moreover,
that notwithstanding she was 111313331εά 13 10 S. 310 W., she had ao difficulty, even under these circumstances,
of clearing St. Roque, and of arriving at Pernambuco 36 days out.

1 have heard of such puffs of wind about Para as dismasted the “ Mermaid,” but never in this region before.
There was a vessel of war some years ago, 13 1113 mouth of the Amazon, that had her sorward sails and some
of her spars carried away by one of those “ puffs” when there was not wind enough ast to fill the mizzen

topsail. Such ‘⁶ whiffs,” 1 understand, are not unsrequent about the mouth os the Amazon.
