‘⁴ For longitude ΒΥ chronometer at night, the planets, or the largest of the fixed stars are the best objects to
be observed when the horizon is good—the Mer. Alt. of the moon may be used for latitude at night, or in the
fore or asternoon, according to its age.

“ ln taking temperature of surface water, a fresh bucket should be drawn up each time, the thermometer
plunged into it immediately, held there for several minutes, and read while the balb is in the water.

“ For the purpose of ascertaining the existence of under currentS, you will sound at intervals, at the least
of every 30 mileS‚ with 100 fathoms line, if there be as much depth, attaching to the line two thermometers,
one near the lead, and the other 50 fathoms from it. In case you have no thermometers suitable, or should
lose them, then you will attach two hollow non-conducting cylinders with valves opening upward, in the place
of the thermometers, haul the line up briskly, and try quickly the temperature of the water brought up in the
cylinders.

’ “ In case you should find an under current, you will endeavor to ascertain its limits and set with all the
accuracy possible. For rate and direction, a block of wood, or a barrega loaded just to sinking, and suspended
at any required depth by a small float just sufficient to keep it from sinking further, will perhaps be the best
means.

“ The determination of the rate and set of under. currents is an operation which is so modified ΒΥ the
weather and other circumstances, that it must of necessity be left, in a great measure, to the judgment and
mental resources of the operators. The officers of the “ Taney” will perhaps have abundant opportunity to
display their ingenuity with regard to the subject. The lead used in sounding for temperatures should be
painted white, and the distance at which it disappears going down and reappears coming up should be entered
in fathoms in the transparency column.

“ The ‘ Taney’ will be provided with the means of sounding at great depthS. It is desirable to reach the
botto'm at every attempt, for the depth of the ocean is an important clement towards a perfect understanding of
the tides, their laws of motion, the course and form of the tidal wave and the like.

“ At the distance of every two hundred miles across the ocean, soundings must be made all the way, both
going and returning, with the view to reach the bottom and determine the depth of the sea. The “ Taney,'⁵
has been provided with the necessary apparatus therefor. In each case the lead must be armed, the specimens
of the bottom which it may bring up must be preserved in a bottle, with a lable attached showing the date,
place and the depth. The time selected sor these soundings should be calm weather, when the sea is smooth,
and when there is 3 likelihood of its so continuing for several hours at least. In hauling up the sounding line
from great depths‚ care should be taken to prevent the lead srom having too great an upward motion, lest by
turning around it should twist the line in two. Therefore in hauling it up frequent pauses should be made to

allow the line to untwist. It is desirable, also, to have specimens of water from the greatest depths.
