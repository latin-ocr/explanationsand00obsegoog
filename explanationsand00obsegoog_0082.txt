Rich and mellow paintings over head—sketched one :—A narrow slate color-ed ribbou circumscribed the horizon,
and upon it reposed a broad belt of vermilion, interspersed with soft dashes of India ink, shaded with umber.
This glowing field merged insensibly above into a bright cream or yellus), (a new firmamental tint‚)‘aud this
into a delicate pale green, which deepened upwards as it approached the summit of the dome3 while over
all, amber-stained 1333333 floated diminishing in size‚ but deepening iu tone, as they descended‚ and varying

in figure everywhere.

“January 13. Latitude 160 07' N ., longitude 310 13’ W. The wind is strongfrom the east, and brings
with it a 11113 munuum: rownna, whose presence is visible 03 the windward side of the 33113 and rigging‚ and
is thought to heve been collecting fot the past two days. It is only by bringing the bur or loose fibres on
the outside of a rope, between the eye and the sun, that its presence and color are made manifest. The
Captaiu calls it African send—says he has observed the like before. The moon this evening, as well as the

sun during the day, obscured by mist—-supposed to be, in some measure, caused by the atmosphere being

surnharged with the dust.

31 sunset 740. Sun clouded most of the day. The vessel ploughs up flying-fish‚ which, as they wing
their way, one can hardly believe they are not swallows. At, 31111 after sunset, appeared panoramic paintingS,
which no human pencil could approximate, nor human pen portray half their beauties.

emerald, which, as it descended‚ vanished through a stratu aaut into brilliant white at 250 above,and continued
with hcremhg brightness, near ‘to the horizon. The heaving waves at our feet, constituting the dark and
bold foreground of 1113 picture, bad dwindled into rest, 3311 3 pale band os misty brown 50 or 60 in depth,
ran, as usual, round the horizon, its upper and broken edge, of course, in strong relies. ⁰

“ Upon it tested, in one line, two adjoining streaks or short strata, os unequal length, densely black, and
:hadad menow with umber. Two smaller lay just above, between one of which and the longest below, the
glowiQ orb peeped out. They did not open sufficiently to show the perfect ball. Portions of its upper and
lower boundaries were hid. Three more small strata of a deep chocolate hue were gracefully arrayed above,
in manner of an eye-brow. ·

“ Behind, and stretching far above, was something like a fawn colored fan, half opened, whose letvtss⁵
were marked with silvei· rays, proceeding from, and centering in, the orb. A similar fan reversed was uu·
folded immediately 1101103111, but assumed a darker shade from 1110 misty belt over which it spread, and now
the fimet uait—some eight or nine cumuli, pieturesquely shaped, and of the parcet crema cosor, formed 8
broken 31011 over tbe whole. The crown of this wide curve reached high into the emerald field; its 11711180 x
of smaller 1333330 descended through the glistening ereum and white nearly to the dark band at the base Of
all. The highest portiom of it were of 3 lighter tinge than those below, so much so, that in the varying
back grounds the whole appeared in equal relief. ¹

again.
