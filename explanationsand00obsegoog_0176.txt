per hour. This is within the region of the trade winds—and here we often noticed the upper light clouds,
the cirri, moving from the westward, while the lower strata moved with the prevailing winds from the east-

ward‚ thus indicating the existence of an upper current of winds counter to the trades.
We first crossed the Guff Stream on the 31st October3 we struck into it in latitude 370 22¹ N.‚ longitude

710 26’ W., as indicated by the temperaturos of the water, which were as follows:
8 A. M. water at sursace 660, air 540

9 ιι ιι ιι 730, ιι 530
. 10 ιι ιι ιι 760, ιι 550
11 ιι ιι ιι 770, ιι 560

Making a S. S. Ε. course good at the rate os six knots per hour. 770 was the highest temperature found in
the stream in crossing it this time. We were set by it to the eastward, at the rate of3.6 knots per hour. We

got out of it, judging from the water getting back to 700, in latitude 360 16’ Ν., longitude 700 56' W., bear-
ing srom the point of entrance S. 200 Ε., distant 71 miles. This 71 miles would, therefore, appear the breadth

between those points oflatitude and longitude; no doubt, however, the surface breadth varies considerably, as
also the velocity, affected by the winds and other causes unknown. We encountered the usual bad weather,
and suffered much in our little craft from a very heavy, irregular, and topling sea, which kept the decks flooded.

Recrossing this stream on our return, on May 30th‚ we entered it in latitude 350 30‘ N.‚ longitude 720

790 uas the highest temperature found, when at the same time it was 770 at 50 fathom8‚ and 740 at 100
fathoms. Its velocity‚ as felt by us in crossing this time, was 25 knots per hour, setting N. 770 Ε. We got
out of it in latitude 360 42' N.‚ longitude 720 10‘ W., bearing from the point of entrance N. 160 E„ distant 78

The temperatures‚ on leaving it, stood as follows, the air being 660 :
