Notwithstanding the tables and explanations given in the body of this work, concerning the route to Rio,
1 find navigators who attempt to follow the chartS, frequently setting up their own indl’vidual experience against
that which the charts give os the multitude3 and generally as often as they do this, 1 find them going astray,
prolonging their passage, or committing blunders of some sort for which there is no necessity, and sor which
owners and the commerce of the country are made to suffer.

,T he tracks with the arrows (Plates vl and Vll) are the tracks which Ι have recommended, and the dotted
tracks are some of the tracks which have actually been performed.

Novv, suppose we had the tracks of a hundred ships, hence to Rio, all made in the month of January of
different years; that in every instance and with every change of wind, each one os the ships making these
tracks had have been managed without a mistake—that they had in every instance steered the best course it
was possible to steer—that when necessary to go about, each one had gone about exactly at the right moment;
and, that whenever the wind came out abead, they had, all ot them, without exception. invariably gone off on
the right tack3 and that the tracks of these hundred vessels—no two of them having, let it be supposed, sailed
in company—was projected on a chart before us. What should we have ? We should probably have a hundred
separate tracks, for it can scarcely be supposed that any two of thern would coincitle all the way. And the
navigator with that chart before him, would have displayed before him, as clear as he has the Sun at mid-day
in a cloudless sky, the best route to Rio in the month of J anuary.

Now, suppose that with these 100 tracks before us, we should wish to draw a line or describe a route, which

should represent the mean average track of the entire 100 ships· We should then point to this track and say,
this is the route pursued‚by these 100 vesseIS, and this, therefore, is the route for all vessels to take in the month
os January3 and when 'we should come to look at the January route thus recommended, we should find, prob·
ably, that not one of these 100 vessels had actually sailed, even for one mile, or for one foot, upon it; that they
had crossed this mean path, now in this place, now in tha23 at one time srom this side, and again from that.
Under such circumstances, no right-minded mariner would hesitate for a moment about taking this route. But
he would not attempt to describe, with the keel of his ship, the line that he had drawn on 'the chart merely to
designate the· parts of the ocean through which she was to pass.

Now, this has been actually done with regard to the routes here recommended: they are the mean or ave·'

rage tracks, in some parts of the way, os 700 such vessels in a month ; in other parts, only for 20, or what·

ev er be the number of ohservations that could be procured.

It is true, that in the case of the charts, 1 have not actually had 100 such unerring vessels to give me the
mean or best average route for each month, but 1 have had what perhaps was better. 1 have had the direction
of the wind in each district of the ocean given sor 100 times and upwards for each month in different years;
and when the navigator is told the direction whence the wind comes, he can tell as well what course he could
have steered as though he had himself been there, and actually steered it.

Ῑ have, therefore, summed up all the winds and calms for each month in every district on the Pilot Chart,

and calculated the chances os head winds, and of fair winds, sor every point of the compass, through every
