easily broken hy a light strain with the hand. It appeared as well as any other portion, and it is highly prob-
ahle that the results of yesterday are attributable to a similar cause.

“ March sch, 1851.—We are now running towards the hanks off Cape Catoche, (Yucatan,) and are not far
from them. The captain thought a cast here would be important, and directed meto get one at 9 A. Μ. We
found bottom with 445 fathoms line; time of running 4 minutes 40 seconds ; temp. air 8203 temp. water 800,
Lat. 220 05’ Ν., Long. 860 22’ W.

“March 15211, 1851.—Having visited Sisal, Campeche, and Laguna, since my last date, running over the
Campeche banks in from 8 to 10 sathoms, as we went from port to port. We sailed from the last named place
this morning. At 5.30 Ρ. Μ. being several miles outside os the deepest soundings laid down upon our chartS,
we got a cast which gave us hottom at 170 sathoms ; the shot ian one minute and twenty-eight seconds; Lat.
190 12’ Ν., Long 920 56' W.; temp. air 8203 temp. water 780.

“ March 18112, 1851.—-At 9 A. Μ. got hottom with 530 fathoms line; time of running seven minutes and
fifteen seconds3 Lat. 190 301 Ν., Long. 940 30’ W. ; temp. air 8103 temp. water 760.

“ At 5 Ρ. Μ. we got another cast, and lound bottorn with 967 fathoms line 3 time of running eleven minuta
and thirty seconds: Lat. 190 37’ Ν., Long. 940 49’ W. ; temp. air 80⁰3 temp. water 780. We also lost two

additional shots by the parting os the line; one in the forenoon‚ and the other in the asternoon. In each case

we lost about a hundred fathoms of line or more.

‘⁴ These two soundings are as exact, in my opinion, as any that can be taken 3 the ship was persectly still,
and the ‚line was nearly up and down.

“ April 2d, 1851.--0n the 17th March, we anchored at the Island of Saerificim, near Vera Cruz, ‘where
we lay until the 28th, when we sailed sor Tarnpico; the passage afforded no opportunity for sounding, as we
ran down quite near to the coast. Yesterday, the lst April, we sailed from Tampico sor Havana3 although
very desirous to run a line of soundings across the Gu‘lf, the weather to·day has been too rough for the opera-
tion, blowing fresh from E. N. E„ and a heavy sea running.

“ April 3d, 1851.—At 9 Α. Μ. got bottom with 490 fathoms line, (waxed ;) time of running six minutes
and five seconds3 Lat. 250 56' N., Long. 950 51¹ W. ; temp. air 8003 temp. water 760.

“ At 5 P. M. made three unsuccessful‘attempts to sonnd, the line parting, each time, at 385, 400, and 405
fathoms; the time os running was 4 minuteS, 3 minutes 40 secondS, and 5 minutes 45 secondS, respectively.
Owing to this discrepancy, 1 am forced to conclude that some mistake was made in marking the line. These
old quartermasters are very liable to err, as you well know, though Peter Alverdron (our signal quartermaster,)
repels such a supposition with disdain, and says the line didn't run so fast the last time as it did the first!

‘⁴ April lst, 1851.—At 9 A. Μ. got bottom with 725 fathoms,waxed line 3 time of running elevcn minutes 3 ’
Lat. 260 58’ Ν., Long. 920 58‘ W.; temp. air 780 ; temp. water 740.

“ How can we account for the great difference in the quantity of line that runs out in equal intervals

of time ?

“ For example, on the 16th ult. we got 967 sathoms in thirty seconds more time only than we had tovday
