1113 difficult‘to assign a reason why these whales are so partia! to a deep sea& when all other kinds sre-
quent shallow bays and harbors. Cuttle or squid, supposed to be the only food which sperm whales ever eat,
are often found in shoal water3 there is however 3 species of this fish, the exact size of which is not known}
but it is presumed to be large, as whaleS, in the agony of death, frequently eject from their stomachs pieces as
large as the bulk of 3 barrel, and these in large quantities3 so that the assertion os the naturaiists that the
whale, though the largest of 3111111313, 13 0113 os the smallest 331313, 13 untrue. Large pieces of squid are often
seen floating on the sea, which wlnalers consider indicate good whale ground.

'l'he manner in which they take their food is rather curiouS, and affords a singular specimen of animal in-
genuity. While the whale is making little or no progress though the sea, its capacious mouth is extended,
by having the lower jaw dropped down, and the inside being white the squid dart swistly in. Whales are often
seen in this position, aad it is known that squid will spring at white and shining objects in the sea, for in this
way are they caught. But‘for this stratagem, the whale might seek other food than the squid : for they are
extremely active, 3ηά ifpursued, could, by frequent evolutionS, easily evade -the pursuit of a whale.

The general color os this species of whale is a dark bluish grey, though some have large and irregular
formed spots of white on them. The exterior surface of the animal is a thin tender- substance of a glass·like
slickneSS, which is easily broken, and forms what anatomists might call the cuticle3 beneath this and upon the

blubber is a short, soft, furry substance, thatx covers the whole whale. The blubber is of various thicknesses

upon different parts of the body, 3ηά may average about 9 11131133, though this depends wholly on the size of

-the whale. Some os this species have yielded 120 beS. of 011, 3ηά 33 11113 3011133 only from the head and blub-

ber, some notion may be formed of the enormous bulk of a large whale. Such a mass of animation cannot
weigh less than sixty tons, and yet this animal, by all odds the largest that now exists, and unquestionably the

largest that ever did exist, has, by a love os the marvellouS, been greatly magnified3 when we are told that

whales have been found to measure 160 feet in length, we cannot say, that
“Travellers ne’er did lie.'’

That they are, or ever have been formed of such prodigious length, is wholly improbable} that sword fish and
thrashers attack them, 13 equally so. But lay hyperbole aside‚ and reduce the size of a whale to flat reality‚
and it is then certainly a monster to excite our wonder.

The following are the dimensions and admeasurement of a large sperm whale that yielded 95 bbls. of 011 ; 3ηά
it may be asserted without sear of contradiction, that the description of one which makes the dimensions exceed
these more than a few feet, is entitled to no credence. The whole length of the whale, from the end os the
head to the 3ηά of the tail, was 62 teet3 circumference at the largest part of the body. 32 feet3 head 20 feet
long, under jaw 16 feet long, and contained two rows of teeth, 22 in each; (the upper jaw has seldom any
teeth, and when it does they are very small.) The 1311 was 6 feet long and 16 broad. The head usually yields
about one-third part os the whole quantity of 011 produced. The 1311 of the whale, like that of all the cetaceous
tribe, is horizontal to the body3 and when wielded as it is by a great number of 31113113, 301113 of which are as

large as a manasbwrist, forces an irresistible blow‚ to which a cedar whale·boat forms a puny shield. The 1311
