Commencing at this parallel of 300, therefore, in the North Pacific, and tracing thence the course of the N.

E. trade windS, we shall find that they blow thence, and reach the region of equatorial calms near the Caroline
IslandS. Here they rise up3 but instead of pursuing the same course in the upper stratum of winds through
the southern hemisphere, they, in consequence of the rotation of the earth, are made to take a S. E. course.
They keep in this upper stratum until they reach the calms of Capricorn, between the parallels of 30Ο and 4003
after which they become the prevailing N. ¹W. winds of the southern hemisphere, which correspond to the S.
W. of the northern. Continuing on to the S. E. they are now the surface winds ; they are going from warmer
to cooler latitudes3 they become as the wet sponge, and are abruptly intercepted by the Andes of Patagonia,
whose cold cummit compresses thern, and with its low dew·point squeezes the water out of them. Captain
King found the astonishing sall of water here of nearly 13 feet (151 inches) in 41 days3 and Mr. Darwin re·

ports that the sea water along this part of the South American coast is sometimes quite fresh.

We ought to expect a corresponding rainy region to be found to the North of Oregon3 but there the
mountains are not so high, the obstruction to the S. W. winds is not so abrupt, the highlands are farther from
the coast, and the air which these winds carry in their circulation to that part of the coast, though it be as
heavily charged with moisture as at Patagonia, has a greater extent of country over which to deposit its rain,
and consequently the sall to the square inch will not be as great!

In like manner we should be enabled to say in what part of the world the most equitable climates are to
be found. They are to be found in the equatorial calm8‚ where the N. E. and S. E. trades meet fresh from
the ocean, and keep* the temperature uniform under a canopy of perpetual cloudS.

The mean annual sall of rain on the entire sursace of the earth is estimated at about 5 feet.

To evaporate water enough annually from the ocean to cover the earth, on the average, 5 feet, deep with
rain3 to transport it from one zone to another; and to precipitate it in the right placeS, at suitable times, and
in the proportions due, is the office of the grand atmospherical machine. This water is evaporated principally
from the Torrid Zone. Supposing it all to come thence, we shall have, encircling the earth, a belt of ocean
3‚000 miles in breadth, from which this atmosphere evaporates a layer of water annually 16 feet in depth. And
to hoist up as high as the cloudS, and lower down again, all the water in a lake 16 feet deep, and 3,000
miles broad, and 24,000 long, is the yearly business of this invisible machinery. What a powerful engine is

the atmosphere !†

13, 1851, containing the Rev. G. H. Atktnson’s Meteorological Table, kept in Oregon City, during the month of January, 1851. The
quantity of rain and snow for that mouth is 1363 inches, or about one-third the average quantity that falls here during the year.

published. From it 1 derive valuable information in relation to this, as well as many other subjects. In his Annua! Report to the
Society‚ Dr. Buist, the Secretary‚ states on the authority of Mr. Laidly, the evaporation at Calcutta to be ‘⁸ about 15 feet annually 3 that
between the Cape and Calcutta aver-ages in October and November nearly ξ inch daily 3—betwixt 100 and 200 in the Bay of Bengal it
was found to exceed an inch daily—supposing this to be double the average throughout the year, we should‚’' continues the Doctor,

If, in considering the direct observatione upon the daily rate of evaporation in India, it be remembered that the seasons there are di-
