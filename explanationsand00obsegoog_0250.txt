from the effect os the equatorial belt of calms upon 1118 11810188181, Herndon’s heights, except under the remarkable
banking up of the atmosphere to the windward of the AndeS, are not far from 230 feet too great as com·
pared with the sea level os 1118 Α11811110 81 1118 18011111 of the Amazon.

Assuming the barometer at the level of the sea,for 1118 mouth of the Amazon, to be on 1118. average
30.019, Lieut. Herndon by the boiling point, which agrees well with direct barometric determinations else·
where, makes the city of Para to be 255 feet above the level of the sea.

Para is about 90 miles from 1118 588, 111 an alluvial country; it is about 15 feet above the mean tide-
water level, and is we suppose that the river has thence to the sea a total fall of 10 feet, (more than an inch to

the mile,) we should make Para 25 feet above 1118 588 level. It can scarcely be much more than 25 feet, be·

cause we know, or rather because we are entitled to assume that the Amazon has no very great rate os

, descent near its mouth.

Assuming‚ then, that Para is only 25 feet above the level of the sea, Herndon’s mean boiling point 81
Ρ81’8, reduced 10 1118 588 level, would be equivalent to a mean barometric pressure of 29.64. By the
mean of actual barometric observations taken 81 Ρ818, 118 makes the barometer at the sea level, supposing
Para tonbe 25 feet only above it, 2957, his readings being corrected for temperature only.

Π 1118 Andes offered no obstruction to the passage of the trade winds——if there were no barometric ano-
malies resulting from the rising up os this chain of mountains into the air—and if we had a series os accurate
barometric readings from Chasuta, (the head of navigation on the Amazon‚) down tes-the sea, we might expect
that the elevation above the sea, as determined from such observations, would gradually decrease srom the foot
of the mountains 10 1118 Α1188110. ⁹

There would in such a series os measurementS, be expressed, it is true, upon the resulting heights, 1118
effect of diurnal changes os the barometer3 and if the person making 1118 011581ν8110115 were to be occupied for
several months in descending the river with his 11810188181, 1118 agency of the perodical barometric changes
would also be peceived by their effects upon his determinations of elevation. 1 am supposing in this case of
imagined barometric heights, that such an observer would have no corresponding observations at 1118 sea-level,

and that the height of the barometer at the mouth of the Amazon would be considered a constant.

The mean monthly heights of 1118 11810188181· 81 Para, as observed by Dewey in 1846, 1847, and 1848,

and till May, 1849, showed an extreme range of only 0.41 in., viz: from 30.02, which was the monthly mean
for July, 1846, to 29.61‚ which was the monthly mean for September, 1846.

The fluctuations arising from the monthly barometric changes might give the line os descent along the

Amazon, as determined in this way, a wave·like appearance, amounting, perhaps, to 300 01 400 feet at most.
But in the case before uS, the change actually amounted to something like 2,000 seet. For aster Herndon

had descended the river 707 1111185, and approached with its current the sea level 571 feet, he was then 1‚589

feet higher 11188 118 was when he set off.

We cannot, therefore, well conceive how we could find from such a source as daily or monthly changes
