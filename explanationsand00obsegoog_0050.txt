There is no calling os men who have done more for philosophy than mariners, and any one who will take
the trouble to examine Plate 1, which is made up entirely of observations by this much abused claSS, will find
it abounding with philosophical truthS, principles and instruction. More than any other clasS, the sailor is
accustomed to observe, upon the great deep, the workings of nature, and he, to be fit for his calling, must be a
philosopher in the truest sense of the term.

Upon this Plate he sees marked out in the most beautiful and striking manner, the path of the “wind in
his circuits” over the part of the ocean to which it relates. He perceives by examination that the law which
governs the wind in district A is not the law which governs it in district B.

That in the former, the mouth of September is remarkable for the consistency and steadiness with which
the wind clings to the S. W. quadrant. That in thelatter, it is all around the compass for September, inclining
to prevail most from the N. E. quadrant. After looking at A, he will conclude thar every season of the year,
winter, spring, summer and autumn, may be said there to have each its own monsoons or peculiar system of
winds. The winds take almost from December to September, gradually to get round from northward and
eastward, to southward and westward3 and they leap back almost at a single bound, it may be said, in the ,
month of October.

There are' many other respects in which the philosophical navigator (and I hold every properly qualified

. navigator to be a philosopher) will find himself interested with regard to the statistics exhibited in this Plate-

The number expressed in figures denotes the whole number of observations of calms and winds together,
that are recorded for each mouth and district. ‚

In C, the wind in May sets one third of the time at West. But in A, which is between the same paralle18‚
the favorite quarter for the same month is from S. to S. W., the wind setting one third os the time in that
quarter, and only 10 out of 221 times from the west; or on the average, it blows from the West only 1} day
during the mouth of May.

In B, notice the great “ Suu Swing„ of the winds in September, indicating that the change from summer
to winter in that region? is sudden, violent3 from winter to summer, gentle and gradual.

The proposition to collect a great number of Log-books with the view of patiently examining them an, one
by one, of taking from each an exact account of the winds and currents mentioned, and of carefully collecting
all the information to be gathered from such sourceS, touching the industrial pursuits of the sea, and of so pre·
senting that information as to embody the united experience of every navigator, could not fail to commend
itself most favorably to every intelligent and public spirited mariner. The manner in which shipmasters and
owners finally received this proposition has been highly gratifying; and, on account os the co-operation which
1 have received at the hands of this class of my sellow citizenS, the undertaking, though b'ut just begun, has,
nevertheleSS, been crowned with results whichI dared not anticipate.

These results have been beneficial to commerce and navigation in a high degree. Wherever the Charts
have been extended, there has been a great gain of knowledge as to windS‚ &c., consequently a shortening of

voyages and a sat-ing of time, by rendering passages to and fro less uncertain.
