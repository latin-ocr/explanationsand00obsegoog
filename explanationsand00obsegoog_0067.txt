tion, than the shower which they bring with them has in disturbing the course of the GulfStream, and other

great currents of the sea.
From the parallel of about 300 North and South, nearly to the equatur, we have two zones of perpetual

winda, viz: the zone os northeast trades on this side, and uf suutheast un that. They blow perpetually‚ and

are as steady and as constant as the currents os the Mississippi river—always moving in the same direction.
As these two currents of air are constantly flowing from the poles towards the equatur, we are sase in

assuming that the air which they keep in motion must return by some channel to the place near the poles,

whence it came in order to supply the trades. If this were not su, these winds would soon exhaust the polar

regions of atmosphere, and pile it up about the equatur, and then cease to blow for the want of air to make

more wind os.

This return current, therefore, must be in the upper regions of the atmosphere, at least until it passes over
those parallels between which the trade winds are always blowing on the surface. The return current must
also move in the direction opposite to the direction of that wind which it is intended to supply. These direct
and counter currente are also made to move in a sort ofspiral or loxodromic curve, turning to the west as they
go from the poles to the equatur, and in the opposite directiun as they move from the equatur towards the poles·

This turning is caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis,

The earth we know, moves from West to East. Now if we imagine a particle of atmosphere at the
North pole, where it is at rest, to be put in motion in a straight line towards the equatur, we can easily see
how this particle of air, coming from the pole, where it did not partake of the diurnal motion of the Earth,
would,in consequence of its vis inertia, find, as it travels South, the Earth slipping under it, as it were, and thus
it would appear to be coming from the northeast and going towards the southwest: in other words, it would be
a N. E. wind. .

On the other hand, we can preceive how a like particle of atmosphere that starts from the equatur, to take
the place os the other at the pole, would, as it travels North, in consequence of its vis inertia, be going
towards the East fast'er than the Earth. It would, therefore, appear to be blowing from the southwest, and
going towards the northeast, and exactly in the opposite direction to the other. Writing South sor North, the
came takes place between the South pole and the equatur. κ

Now this is the process which is actually going on in nature, and if we take the motions os these two
partit-les as the type of the motion of all, we shall have an illustration of the great currents in the air, the
equatur being near one of the nodeS, and there being two systems of currents—an upper and an under—
betweenit and each pole.

Let us return now to our northern particle, and follow it in a round frum the North pole to the equatur
and back again, supposing it, sor the present, to turn back towards the pole after reaching the equatur.

Setting off from the polar regions, this particle of air, for some reason, which does not appear to have
been satisfactorily explained by philosopherS, travels in the upper regions os the atmosphere, until it gets

near the parallel of 30⁰. Here it meetS, also in the cloudS, the hypothetica! particle that is going from
the equatur to take its place toward the pole.
