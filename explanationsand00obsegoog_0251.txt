in the uniform barometric pressure os Para, such anomalies in barometric determination8‚ heights, and pres-
sures as Fig. Β. is intended to illustrate.

Is the suggestion that the high boiling point of Herndon and the high harometer of Castelnau at Nauta
was caused by the pressure of the trade winds against the Andes, should tu‘rn out correct, and the barometric
observations on the head waters of the Amazon, both of Humboldt and Condamine, tend to confirm it, will not

the Andes be converted into an immense anemometer, by which the force of the trade winds may be deter-

mined ; and if their force, consequently their velocity also?

The Tides qs Somabaya.

Lieut. Marin Jansen, of the Dutch Navy‚ has spent much time in the East IndieS. Among the various
subjects which occupied the attention of this most excellent and accomplished officer, were the Tides of Sour-
abaya: the northern-entrance of which is in lat. 70 3‘ South3 long 112ο 42¹ 30¹¹ East.

Lieut. J ausen, while on a visit to this country on board the “Prince of Orange” frigate in the spring os 1852,
was kind enough to communicate to me the following very interesting and valuable paper touching certain
tidal anomalies in those straitS.

1 quote the result of his observations and his remarks for the benefit of marinerS.

“To find the time qs highwater on both sides qs Straits qs Scarabaija. Tloe Bastern entrance, called “The
'I’rechterss' (sunuel.)

In the eastern entrance to the splendid harbor of Sourabmjy‘a in the Island of Juva, there are two channels,
one called tlte old ckannel, the other Jansen’s channelst

During the whole year, there are every day, two highwaters observed in the Preclzur, but in most occa-
sions they differ from each other in height.

This difference in highwater is occasioned by a tide-wave, that has only once a day highwater, the time
and height of which, alters with the sun’s declination. Upon this wave the common lunar tides make their up
and down motion.

This diurna] wave makes highwater, in day time when the sun’s declination is North, but when it is South
the highwater of the diurnal wave is at night. When the sun is on the equator or his declination Ο, the diur-
nal wave disappears, and it attains its maximum when the sun's declension is greatest.

The common Lunar tides, such as we are accustomed to observe in our harbors, give highwater twice a day,
and must be placed upon the diurnal wave, in combination with which, the absolute highwater observed

in the eastern entrance os the Straits of Sourabaija is formed.
