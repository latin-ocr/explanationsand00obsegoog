lt is proper to mention that the cruising of this ship, in the interval between the dates mentioned in the
first paragraph of this report, was performed in the vicinity of Havana, near which place Ι had already taken
so many soundingS, that 1 was disposed to economise the small quantity of the line 1 then had, so as to use
it in other places not yet visited by me.
Pertunda—April 13th‚ 1852.—1 have the honor to submit to you the result of two deep sea soundings

made on my passage from San J uan de Nicaragua to Havana.

1511: February, 1852.—Sounded and got bottom with 2‚397 fathoms line3 time of running, 47 minutes 29
secondS. Latitude 110 23‘ North, longitude '790 36' West. Temp. air 820, temp. water 820. Drift rather

more than a mile an hour.

leth February, 1852.—Sounded and got bottom with 2,440 fathoms line3 time of running 51 minutes
40 seconds. Latitude 120 251 North, longitude 780 22‘ West. Temp. air 820, temp. water 800. Drist one

mile an hour.

These are the only soundings made since my last report.'’

 

Captain Platt mentions that these soundings were performed generally under the immediate superinten
dence of his accomplished first Lieut., Wm. Rogers Taylor‚ U. S. N.

Lieut Taylor kept minute records of the operations connected with each sounding‚ and had the kind-
ness to furnish me with copies of them, simply for my own satisfaction. It is obvious that he never designed
his souuding journals for publication. But they are not the less valuable sor that reason3 and he will I hope
pardon me the liberty 1 am taking, sor the sake of the motive 1 have in view, which is to let other officers have
the benefit of his experience. The freedom with which the difficulties in his own case are stated 3—his ac·
count of the manner of overcoming them, the statement os his success and his failureS, will all afford most valu-
able assistance to other officers engaged with the same thing, and encountering similar difficulties, It ie,

therefore, that I take the liberty of publishing unofficial papers that were never intended for the public eye.
