If it be the temperature of the water which invites the sperm whale into these extra-tropical regions of
the South Atlantic, we may perhaps obtain from these dumb creatures 33 answer to the question: By what
channel do the waters which the Lagullas current, and the ice·bearing current around Cape Horn, and the
cold current from Baffin’s hay, and the waters which the Mississippi river, the St. Lawrence, and all the
great rivers of Europe, Africa, and America, bring⁴ into the Atlantic ocean—by what channel do ‘these waters
escape and preserve the level of that sea?

These currents bring into the Atlantic water more than enough to supply the waste of evaporation.
The brine of the sea is not· accumulating or concentrating in this ocean, and we therefore know that there

¹rnust be somewhere in this ocean, either at the sursace above or in the depths below, a current of large volume

running from it. 1 have searcbed for it long and patiently. 1 have looked for it—-seeling as certain of its ex-

istence as we do os a thing that 1133 been seen and known to exist, and is lost—but 13 vain.

The components os sea water like the components of the atmosphere are every where the same. It is
true that we find a little more salt in this place, and 3 little less in that3 but this is attributable, not to the want
of 3 general system of aqueous circulation in the terrestrialfeconomy, but rather to local 033333, such as an
excess os precipitation, or an excess of evaporation, or the discharges os fresh water from rivers in the neigh-
borbood. If the water-s of the sea did not pass from 033 climate to another, and from one ocean to another, it
would not be difficult to conceive, why, in the processof time, there should not be as great 3 difference in
the waters in different parts of the great oceanic reservoir of the earth as there is in the waters of the Dead
sea and the Mediterranean, or in the waters of any two seas, between which there is no communication.

The chemist analyzes the waters of the Mediterranea-n and os the Red sea, and detecta the same compo·
nents. Now, unless ⁴the waters os these two seas could intermingle,-—and 1 have traced 3 current from the
033 to the neighborhood of the other—unleszss 1 repeat, there were 33 intermingling between the waters of these

. two 3333, what could preserve the 33313 salts in the same quantities 13 each?

The Red sea, because it is riverless and rainless, receives no salts from the land on its shores. Whereas
the rivers which empty into the Mediterranean have for ages been filtering “ the salt of the earth,'' taking it up
in solution from the soil, and bringing it down with their drainage into this 333.

Now unless nature had provided some means of process, by which the waters of these two 3333 should
regularly intermingle with the waters of the ocean, and through the ocean, with each other, what would
hinder the two scas from salting up their brine with different strength.

No doubt the harmonies os the sea are as beautiful and as sublime as the “ music of the spheres.'’ And
to what agency therefore, if not to the agency of currents and the mobility of water, must we ascribe the per·
manent condition os sea water? for perhaps of all parts os creation that are both tangible and visible to us, the
waters of the sea are most paramount and stable in their characteristics, proportions and constituent&

If nature had not provided 3 general s'ystem of circulation for the waters of the sea, what would prevent

tbe waters of the lfivssediterranean sor instance from absorbing salts and other constituents through its rivers, and
