stopped five minutes. At 6,9oo stopped six minuteS, and at 7 ‚000 fathoms stopped three minutes-the last
100 fathoms taking precisely five minutes to run out.

The first two of these are nearly regular, but the latter three are not. This may be accounted for by our
feeding the line from the reel‚ it now passing out very slowly, but when stopped having the same tension as
before, and as before drawing the boat to windward. The stoppages also must be deducted.

At the 75th hundred, stopped 5} minutas to bring up surface drift. The next one hundred fathoms run
out precisely in 5m. 15³. At the 7802 hundred, stopped 5 minutes; the last 100 fathoms running out in 5m. 153.
At the 79th hundred stopped 9 minuteS. At oh. 29'm. eight thousand fathoms out. At 511. 33.36-8‚100 fathomS.

It was now sundown, and the breeze freshening, we were compelled reluctantly to stop3 though I think

no usesul result would have been attained by continuing to expend line. Began to rouse in3 four men could

haul in but 100 fathoms in ten minuteS. After getting about 300 fathoms the strain became exeeedingly great,
and additional soree being applied, the line parted about 150 fathoms from the surface.

The ‚boat was drawn rapidly astern at first, but after getting the 300 fathoms, her motion was much slower,
and the line trended nearly up and down. It parted finally by a good honest strain, proving itsels more
trustworthy than I had believed.

After the line parted the men sprang to their oarS, and we pulled sor the ship, now over two miles off,
getting on board rather late and not altogether satisfied with the perplexing results os our long day’s work.
In fact all we can say truly of our nine hour’s patient research “in the deep bosom of the ocean,'’ is that of
its depth here we know nothing. The only thing we could congratulate ourselves upon was the unequalled
opportunity. No finer day was ever inventedby dame Nature for such an experiment3 and rs our soundings

do not show the depth of the ocean bed, perhaps they may indicate some other fact, such as the sweep of the

under-current, which may not be without its utility.

But Ι must here state that 1 am at variance with my companion, Mr. Glover, on this very point:
he being convinced that our soundings were fairly measured, and that the ocean here (allowing only
sor sursace drift) is about 8,ooo fathomS, or nearly nine miles deep. As he had the same opportu-
nity as myself to form a correct opinion, and is doubtless equally desirous to obtain the accurate truth, his

opinion is entitled to as much weight as my own. I freely confess that Ι can advance no proof that the shot
