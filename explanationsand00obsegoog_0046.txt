Wherefore, in discussing the requisite forms and instructions for this purpose, I should be glad to have the
assistance in counsel 3ηά advice of the most eminent navigatore.

For these reasons Ι request that the Board of Admiralty, and the Ministers of Marine of France, Russia,
Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Prussia‚ be invited, each to appoint for this purpose, an officer to meet me at
such time 3ηά place as shall be agreed upon.

Respectfully‚ δῖα,
M. F. MAURY,

‚ Lieut. U. S. Navy.

Hon. Jomv P. Kanum, .
Secretary of the Navy, Washington,

 

Waiting for a reply to this communication, to return to the Indian Ocean.
The materials which I have from that ocean, and which have been furnished ,by American navigatorS, at

present engaged in its commerce, are just sufficient to show that there is a 1ich harvest to be gathered there.

A Gulf Stream‚ nearly if not quite equal to our own in the Atlantic‚ has its genesis there. Its waters are
nearly at blood heat3 they frequently reach a temperature of 900. Between the shores of ’China and one of
the sources of this hot stream, but counter to it, is a current of cold water.

In this system of aqueous circulation thus detected, and in the prevailing winds of the Pacific, are· to be
found the conditions which cause the climates of the Atlantic States to be repeated along the coasts of China3
the climate of Western Europe to be reduplicated in Northwestern America. Here in the tepid waters of In⁰dia
which this stream conveys towards the Fox lslands—the Newfoundland of the Pacific ocean—is to be found
the origin of the fogs of the North Pacific, and the European·like climate of Oregon. It may be expected that

the storms which take their rise near the western margin of the Pacific ocean will also follow this stream in

their course.

The passage from China to San Francisco is now made in 54 days. But with the knowledge which
these Charts promise ua, with regard to this stream and the winds of that ocean, there is reason to believe
that the average passage under canvass may be yet still further, and considerably reduced.

There is a part too of the North Pacific which answers to our Sargasso sea of the Atlantic. In it, sea·
weed and drift-wood will probably be found, though not in such quantities as in the Atlantic. I have already
received some information concerning a sort of Sargasso sea in the Pacific.

Bottles containing a paper with the date and place of the ship, and requesting the finder to cause the

same to be published in the¹ nearest newspaper‚ and forwarded to the Superintendent of the National Observa· ·

tory, at Washington, with an account of the time and place at which it may be picked up, would, in many
case8‚ afford much useful, valuable and interesting information concerning the curr‘ents of the Pacific Ocean.
The practice of throwing bottles thus freighted overboard in that and the Indian Ocean is recommended

to navigators who are co-operating with me in these investigations. and a frequent resort to this practice is

earnestly commended to their attention.
