Here depositing a portion of its vapor as it ascendS, it would with the residuum take, on account of dt
rotation, a course in the upper region of the atmosphere to the S. E. as far as the calms of Capricorn.
it descends and continues on towards the coast of South America in the same direction, appeari'ng now a
prevailing N. W. wind of the extra-tropical regions of the southern hemisphere.

Traveling on the surface from warmer to colder regionS, it must, in this part of its circuit, preci1
more than it evaporateS.

Now it is a coincidence, at least, that this is the route by which, on account of the land in the northern he
phere, the N. E. trade winds have the fairest sweep over that ocean. That this is the route by which the-¹
longest in contact with an evaporating surface: the route ,by which all circumstances are most favorable to <
plete saturation ; and this is the route by which they can pass over into the southern hemisphere, most hez
laden with vapors for the extra-tropical regions of that half of the globe3 and this is the supposed route w
the N. E. trade winds os the Pacific take to reach the equator, and to pass from it.

Accordingly, if this process of reasoning be good, that portion of South America between the calm,
Capricorn and Cape Horn, upon the mountain ranges of which this part of the atmosphere, whose circuit l
considering as a type, first impinges, ought to be a region of copious precipitation. 1 accordingly turne(
the hyetography of Berghaus and Johnson, and find it stated, on the authority of Captain King, that upwa
of 12· feet of rain fell there in 41 days· ’

Passing the sn0w2clad summits of the Andes, this same wind tumbles down upon the eastern slo‘¹
os the range, and then traverses the almost rainsess 3ηά barr'en regions of Patagonia and South Buenos Ayr

These conditions, the direction of the prevailing winds, and the amount of precipitation, were regarded
evidence afforded by nature, if not in favor, certainly not against the conjecture that such had beon the voya
of this vapor through the air. At any rate, here was proof of the immense quantity of vapor which th(
winds of the extra-tropical regions carry along with them towards the pole8‚ and 1 could imagine no otl
place than that suggested, whence these winds could get so much vapor.

l am not unaware of the theory or of the weight attached to it, which requires precipitation to take pla

in the upper regions os the atmosphere on account os the cold there, irrespective of proximity to mountain to
3ηά suoru-clad hills.

But the facts and conditions developed by these charts are in many respects irreconcilable with that theor
With a new system of facts before me, Ι have, independent of all preconceived notions and opinionS, set aboi
to seek among them sor explanations and reconciliationS.

Arrived at this stage in the process os deduction and finding conformity, the next step was to trace bac
the vapor that supplies the sources of the Mississippi river and its tributaries with rain, to its place in tl

ocean whence it came3 (for that the vapor of water is distributed over the earth by the winds, and not b

permeation, my researches abundantly prove.)
