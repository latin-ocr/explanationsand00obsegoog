mi'nd that on account of the absence of great deserts in South America, that that continent by reason· of its
windward position with regard to the S. Ε. tradeS, interferes less with their strength and regularity than large
bodies of land do generally, when, with extensive deserts and arid plainS, they are to windward of the

trades. Thus Africa, with its deserts‚ is to the windward both of the N. Ε. and S. Ε. trades of the Atlantia
And what have we ἓ Why a total interruption of the trades along its Atlantic coasts, and a navigation the

most tedious and perplexing, along its inter-tropical shore lines.

Again, consider the baffiing winds along the western coasts of inter-tropical North America. Here, on ac·
count os agencies already explained, the N. Ε. Trade winds are overpowered‚ and the navigation of the Pa-
cific coasts of Central America rendered very, very tedious.

Novv, off the Pacific coasts of South America, we have no such agents as great deserts in the interior to
interrupt the S. E. trades, and consequently no such regions of calms‚ “little monsoonS‚'’ and baffiing winds‚

to try the patience os navigatorS, as we have under the lee of trade-wind Africa, and of trade-wind North
America.

Theiefore, aster you have doubled Cape Horn, and gained an offing from the land, there is no necessity
for running a thousand miles or more off from the South American coast, as from the coasts of Central America
you have to do, in order to get better winds‚ The chief advantage of making, while South of the parallel of
350 or 400 S. ‚ the meridiari near which you intend to cross the equator‚ is, that there the degrees of longitude
are short, and therefore easy to run down 3, and that when you have made your westing down‘there, you can
spread the more eanvass when you get the S. E. trades which you will then have on the quarter. If you put
off making westing until you get these winds‚ you will then have to stand away to the Northward and west-
ward through them, which course will bring them ast, and therefore make them less favorable.

In April you will carry them generally a little further beyond the Line than in March.

In May, the experience of the ten navigators who crossed between the meridians of 1050 and 127 0 would,
at first sight, seem to indicate that between 1150 and 1200 is the best crossing for this mouth. But when we
come to consider the sailing qualities of the vessels concerned, we find reason to believe that the difficulties of
the passage do not depend upon where you cross the Line in May, provided you do not cross to the East of 1000 ·,

but the difficulties are at other turning points to be mentioned hereafter.

The three vessels from the United States whose ‘crossings turn the scale in favor of these two meridians

are all fast ships. One of them, the “ Wisconsin,” is a clipper. She crossed in 1190-100 days from New
York—and had 24 days thence to California. On the other hand, of the three from the United States that crossed

between 1100 and 1150, one also was a clipper, viz: the “ Stag Hound.'’ She crossed in 1130—93 days
from New York 3—she had 21 days thence to San FranciscO. Of the three that crossed between 1050 and 1100,
two were clippers, and the other dull. The “ Grey Feather‚” clipper, crossed in 1100—108 days from New
York ;—she had 28 days thence to port. The “ Tornado,” clipper, crossed in 1070, 84 days from New York.

She had 44 days from this crossing to San Francisco. Bad Luck.
It appears t'herefore, with the feeble light which these passages afford as to the best California route for
